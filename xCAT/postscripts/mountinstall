# This script, ("mountinstall"), is a sample xCAT post script for 
#	mounting /install from managment node to xCAT chef-server
#	nodes.  
#
#	Make sure your script is executable and that is is in the 
#	/install/postscripts directory on the xCAT management node.
#
#	You must add the script name to the list of scripts that 
#	must be run at install time,  or use it with updatenode.
#
# 	To use this script you should make sure it gets run before the 
#	"loadchefdata" script or any other scipts that may need to use
#       scripts in the /install directory.
#	
#	For example, to get it to run before the "loadchefdata" script you
#	could set the "postbootscripts" attribute of the chef-server node
#	definitions as follows:
#
#	chdef -t node -o chef-server postbootscripts="mountinstall,loadclouddata"	
#
