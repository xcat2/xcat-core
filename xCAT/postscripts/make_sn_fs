# This script, ("make_sn_fs"), is a sample xCAT post script for 
#	creating file systems on xCAT service
#	nodes.  You can modify this script to create and mount local 
#	file systems when the service nodes are installed.
#
#	Make sure your script is executable and that is is in the 
#	/install/postscripts directory on the xCAT management node.
#
#	You must also add the script name to the list of scripts that 
#	must be run at install time.  (See below.)
#
# 	To use this script you should make sure it gets run before the 
#	"servicenode" script or any other scipts that may need to use these 
#	file systems.
#	
#	For example, to get it to run before the "servicenode" script you
#	could set the "postbootscripts" attribute of the service node
#	definitions as follows:
#
#	chdef -t node -o service postbootscripts="make_sn_fs,servicenode"	
#

# create file systems
/usr/sbin/crfs -v jfs2 -g rootvg -m /install -a size=80G -A yes
/usr/sbin/crfs -v jfs2 -g rootvg -m /nodedata -a size=10G -A yes
/usr/sbin/crfs -v jfs2 -g rootvg -m /sn_local -a size=10G -A yes

# mount the files systems
/usr/sbin/mount /install
/usr/sbin/mount /nodedata
/usr/sbin/mount /sn_local

# add entries to the /etc/exports file
/usr/bin/echo "/sn_local-rw,anon=0" >> /etc/exports
/usr/bin/echo "/nodedata -rw,anon=0" >> /etc/exports

# export the file systems
/usr/sbin/exportfs /install
/usr/sbin/exportfs /nodedata
/usr/sbin/exportfs /sn_local
