# Kit Build File
#
# This file was initially auto-generated by the buildkit CLI command.
# To create a new kit, the user should modify this file accordingly.
# Refer to the buildkit manpage for further details.

# kitrepo: This section defines a Kit Package Repository.
#          There must be at least one kitrepo section in a kit build file.
#          If you want to support multiple OSes, you should create a separate
#          repo for each OS.  Also, no two repos can be defined with the same
#          OS name, major/minor version and arch. For example, you cannot have
#          two repos for RHEL 6.2 x86_64 in the same kit.

# kitcomponent: This section defines one Kit Component.
#               There can be zero or more kitcomponent sections.
#               If you want to build a component which supports multiple OSes,
#               you should create one kitcomponent section for each OS.
#               Also, no two components in a kit can be defined with the same
#               base name.
#               You can define multiple kit components with the same base name
#               only if each kit component using this base name meets these
#               requirements:
#                 - Each kit component must be defined with the same version
#                   and release number
#                 - Each kit component must be defined with a unique kitrepoid

#                       kitpackage section. Each package must be in the same

# kitpackage: This section defines one Kit Package, and how to build it.
#             There can be zero or more kitpackage sections.
#             All filenames should be relative paths to
#                <Kit Build Directory>/source_packages
#             If you want to build a package which can run on multiple OSes,
#             you have two options:
#               1. Build a separate package for each OS you want to support.
#                  For this option, you need to define one kitpackage section
#                  per supported OS.
#               2. Build one package that can run on multiple OSes.
#                  If you are building an RPM package, you are responsible for
#                  creating an RPM spec file that can run on multiple OSes.
#                  For this option, you need to define one kitpackage section
#                  which contains multiple kitrepoid lines.
#
# kitpackage attributes:
#    filename   (mandatory) Package filename
#    kitrepoid  (mandatory) The repo(s) this package belongs to.
#                 If multiple repos are defined, the package will be built for
#                 the first repo only. For the other repos, a symlink is created
#                 to the package built for the first repo.
#   Package build methods (optional)
#                 Define how to build the packages.
#                 If you don't specify a build method, the default behavior is
#                 to assume the package is pre-built under
#                   <Kit Build Directory>/source_packages
#                 All files in this section are relative to
#                   <Kit Build Directory>/source_packages
#                 There are four methods to build packages.
#                   1. Use pre-built RPM package
#                       isexternalpkg:  'no'|'0', 'yes'|'1'  (default:  'no')
#                         Indicates whether the RPM package will be added to the
#                         the kit tar file now as part of the kit build process,
#                         or whether the customer will need to separately
#                         obtain the RPM pacakage and add it to the kit tar file
#                         using 'buildkit addpkgs'
#                       rpm_prebuiltdir: If isexternalpkg=no, path to directory
#                         containing pre-built RPM package
#                   2. Build RPM from spec + src dir
#                       rpm_spec:   Path to spec file.
#                       rpm_srcdir: Path to source directory.
#                   3. Build RPM from spec + src tarball
#                       rpm_spec:        Path to spec file.
#                       rpm_srctarball:  Path to source tarball.
#                   4. Build RPM from source RPM
#                       rpm_srpm:  Path to source RPM package.
