# Kit Build File
# 
# A unique version of this file is automatically generated for a new Kit
# when you run the buildkit command to create a new Kit. The basic template 
# for this file is contained in the /opt/xcat/share/xcat/kits/kit_template 
# directory.  Once the initial version of this file is generated you will
# have to modify it by adding the details needed to build your new Kit.
#
# Refer to the buildkit manpage for further details.
#

# kitrepo: This stanza defines a Kit Package Repository.
#          There must be at least one kitrepo stanza in a kit build file.
#          If you want to support multiple OSes, you should create a separate

# kitcomponent: This stanza defines one Kit Component.
#               There can be zero or more kitcomponent stanzas.
#               If you want to build a component which supports multiple OSes,
#               you should create one kitcomponent section for each OS.
#               You can define multiple kit components with the same base name
#               only if each kit component using this base name meets these
#               requirements:
#                 - Each kit component must be defined with the same version
#                   and release number

#                       the file will not be built into the kit tarfile, but
#                       will need to be added later with a 'buildkit addpkgs'
#                       command.
#                       Files will be placed in
#                         /opt/xcat/kits/<kitbasename>/<kitcomponent_name>
#                       when the kitcomponent package is deployed to an
#                       OS image.
#                       Kit component deployment scripts must be specified

# kitpackage: This stanza defines one Kit Package.
#             There can be zero or more kitpackage stanzas.
#
#             If you want to build a package which can run on multiple OSes,
#             you have two options:
#               1. Build a separate package for each OS you want to support.
#                  For this option, you need to define one kitpackage stanza
#                  per supported OS.
#               2. Build one package that can run on multiple OSes.
#                  If you are building an RPM package, you are responsible for
#                  creating an RPM spec file that can run on multiple OSes.
#                  For this option, you need to define one kitpackage stanza
#                  which contains multiple kitrepoid lines.
#
#
# kitpackage attributes:
#   filename   (mandatory) Package filename. The filename may contain 
#                         wildcards to avoid needing to
#                       specify an explicit package version-release filename.
#
#   kitrepoid  (mandatory) A comma-separated list of kit repo names this package
#                 belongs to.  If multiple repos are defined, the package will
#                 be built for the first repo only. For the other repos,
#                 a symlink is created to the package built for the first repo.
#
#    isexternalpkg  (mandatory) Indicates if the package will be included 
#                      in this kit or added later.
#                   'no' or '0' means the package is included.
#                   'yes' or '1'  means the packages will be added later.
#                   The default if not set is 'no'.
#
#    rpm_prebuiltdir  (mandatory IF isexternalpkg=no)  Path to the directory 
#                      containing the pre-built RPMs relative to 
#                   <Kit Build Directory>/source_packages directory.
#                   For example, if the file is 
#                   "<Kit Build Directory>/source_packages/foobar/foo.rpm" 
#                   then set "rpm_prebuiltdir=foobar".
