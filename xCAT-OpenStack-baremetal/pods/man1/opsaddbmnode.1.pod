=head1 NAME

B<opsaddbmnode> - It adds xCAT baremetal nodes to an OpenStack cloud.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<opsaddbmnode> I<noderange> B<-s> I<service_host>

B<opsaddbmnode> [B<-h>|B<--help>]

B<opsaddbmnode> [B<-v>|B<--version>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<opsaddbmnode> command registers xCAT nodes to an OpenStack cloud. An OpenStack nova baremetal node registration command takes several node attributes:

=over

=item BMC ip addresss, user id and password

=item Name of nova compute host which will control this baremetal node

=item Number of CPUs in the node

=item Memory in the node (MB)

=item Local hard disk in the node (GB)

=item MAC address to provision the node

=back

The opsaddbmnode command pulls the above baremetal node information from xCAT tables and calls "nova baremetal-node-create" to register the baremetal node with the OpenStack cloud.

Please make sure the following xCAT tables are filled with correct information for the given nodes before calling this command.

=over

=item ipmi (for BMC ip addresss, user id and password)

=item mac (for MAC address)

=item hwinv (for CPU, memory and disk info.)

=back

=head1 Parameters

I<noderage> is a comma separated node or node group names. 


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 10

=item B<-s>    The node name of the OpenStack compute host that hosts the baremetal nodes. 

=item B<-h|--help>     Display usage message.

=item B<-v|--version>  The Command Version.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUE

0  The command completed successfully.

1  An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1

To register node1, node2 and node3 to OpenStack, sv1 is the compute host.

   opsassbmnode node1,node2,node3 -s sv1
