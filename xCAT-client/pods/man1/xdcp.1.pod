=head1 B<DESCRIPTION>

The B<xdcp> command concurrently copies files  to  or  from  remote  target
nodes. The command issues a remote copy command for each node or device specified. When files are  pulled  from a target,  they  are  placed  into  the  I<targetpath> with the name of the
remote node or device appended to  the  copied  I<sourcefile>  name.  The
B</usr/bin/rcp> command is the model for syntax and security.
If using hierarchy, then B<xdcp> runs on the service node that is servicing the compute node. The file will first be copied to the path defined in the site table, B<SNsyncfiledir> attribute, or the default path B</var/xcat/syncfiles> on the service node, if the attribute is not defined. The B<-P> flag will not automatically copy
the files from the compute node to the Management node, hierarchically.  There
is a two step process, see B<-P> flag.
If the Management Node is target node, it must be defined in the xCAT database with B<nodetype=mn>. When the B<xdcp> command runs with the Management Node as the target, it does not use remote commands but uses the local OS copy (B<cp>) command.

B<REMOTE> B<USER>:

A I<user_ID> can be specified for the remote copy command. Remote user
specification is identical for the B<xdcp> and B<xdsh> commands. 
See the B<xdsh> command for more information.

B<REMOTE> B<COMMAND> B<COPY>:

The  B<xdcp>  command  uses  a  configurable remote copy command to execute
remote copies on remote targets. Support is explicitly  provided  for
Remote  Shell  B<rcp>  command,  the  OpenSSH  B<scp>  command  and  the
B</usr/bin/rsync> command.

For node targets, the remote copy command is determined by the  following order of precedence:


1. The B<-r> flag.

2. The B</usr/bin/rsync> command.

B<COMMAND> B<EXECUTIONS>:

The  maximum  number  of  concurrent remote copy command processes (the
fanout) can be specified with the B<-f> flag or the DSH_FANOUT environment
variable.  The  fanout is only restricted by the number of remote shell
commands that can be run in  parallel.  You  can  experiment  with  the
DSH_FANOUT  value on your management server to see if higher values are
appropriate.

A timeout value for remote copy command execution can be specified with
the B<-t> flag or DSH_TIMEOUT environment variable. If any remote target
does not respond within the timeout value, the B<xdcp> command displays  an
error message and exits.

The B<-T> flag provides diagnostic trace information for B<xdcp> command execution. Default settings and the actual remote copy commands that are executed to the remote targets are displayed.

The B<xdcp> command can be executed silently using the B<-Q> flag; no target
standard output or standard error is displayed.

=head1 B<OPTIONS>

=over 5

=item I<sourcefile...>

Specifies the complete path for the file to be  copied  to  or
from  the  target.  Multiple files can be specified. When used
with the B<-R> flag, only a single directory  can  be  specified.
When  used  with the B<-P> flag, only a single file can be specified.

=item I<targetpath>

If one source file, then it specifies the file to copy the source
file to on the target. If multiple source files, it specifies
the directory to copy the source files to on the target.
If the B<-P> flag is specified, the I<targetpath> is the local host location
for the copied files.  The remote file directory structure is recreated
under I<targetpath> and  the  remote  target  name  is  appended
to  the   copied I<sourcefile> name in the I<targetpath> directory.
Note: the I<targetpath> directory must exist.

=item B<-B>|B<--bypass>

Runs in bypass mode, use if the B<xcatd> daemon is not responding.

=item B<-f>|B<--fanout> I<fanout_value>

Specifies a fanout value for the maximum number of  concurrently  executing  remote shell processes. Serial execution
can be specified by indicating a fanout value of B<1>.
If B<-f> is not specified, a default fanout value of B<64> is used.

=item B<-F>|B<--File> I<synclist input file>

Specifies the path to the file that will be used to
build the B<rsync> command.
The format of the input file is described here: <https://xcat-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/admin-guides/manage_clusters/common/deployment/syncfile/syncfile_synclist_file.html>

On Linux B<rsync> always uses ssh remoteshell. On AIX, B<ssh> or B<rsh> is used depending on the B<site.useSSHonAIX> table attribute.

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Displays usage information.


=item B<-i>|B<--rootimg> I<install image>


Specifies the path to the install image on the local Linux node.


=item B<-o>|B<--node-options> I<node_options>

Specifies options to pass to the remote shell  command  for
node  targets.  The options must be specified within double
quotation marks ("") to distinguish them from B<xdcp> options.

=item B<-p>|B<--preserve>

Preserves  the  source  file characteristics as implemented by
the configured remote copy command.

=item B<-P>|B<--pull>

Pulls (copies) the files from the targets and places  them  in
the I<targetpath> directory on the local host. The I<targetpath> must
be a directory. Files pulled from  remote  machines  have
B<._target>  appended  to  the  file  name to distinguish between
them. When the B<-P> flag is used with the B<-R> flag,  B<._target>  is
appended to the directory. Only one file per invocation of the
B<xdcp> pull command can be pulled from the specified  targets.
In hierarchy, you must first pull
the file to the service node and then pull the file to the management
node.

=item B<-q>|B<--show-config>

Displays the current environment settings for all DSH
Utilities commands. This includes the values of all environment
variables  and  settings  for  all  currently installed and
valid contexts. Each setting is prefixed with  I<context>:  to
identify the source context of the setting.


=item B<-r>|B<--node-rcp> I<node remote copy command>

Specifies  the  full  path of the remote copy command used for syncing files to node targets, such as B</usr/bin/rsync> or B</usr/bin/scp>. If not specified, B<rsync> will be used by default.

Note: The synclist processing for B<-r /usr/bin/scp> has some differences with B<-r /usr/bin/rsync>:

1) the B<EXECUTE> clause in synclist file is not supported with B<-r /usr/bin/scp> flag

2) if the destination directory specified in synclist file is an existing file on target node, B<xdcp -r /usr/bin/scp> will fail with "scp: <destination directory>: Not a directory"

3) if the destination file specified in synclist file is an existing directory on target node, B<xdcp -r /usr/bin/scp> will fail with "scp: <destination file>: Is a directory"


=item B<-R>|B<--recursive>

Recursively  copies files from a local directory to the remote
targets, or when specified with the B<-P> flag, recursively pulls
(copies)  files  from  a remote directory to the local host. A
single source directory can be specified using the I<sourcefile> parameter.


=item B<-s> I<synch service nodes>

Will only sync the files listed in the synclist (B<-F>), to the service
nodes for the input compute node list. The files will be placed in the
directory defined by the B<site.SNsyncfiledir> table attribute, or the default
B</var/xcat/syncfiles> directory.

=item B<-t>|B<--timeout> I<timeout>

Specifies the time, in seconds, to wait for output from any
currently executing remote targets. If no output is
available  from  any  target in the specified I<timeout>,
B<xdsh> displays an error and terminates execution for the remote
targets  that  failed to respond. If I<timeout> is not specified,
B<xdsh> waits indefinitely to continue processing output  from
all  remote  targets.  When specified with the B<-i> flag, the
user is prompted for an additional timeout interval to wait
for output.

=item B<-T>|B<--trace>

Enables trace mode. The B<xdcp> command prints diagnostic
messages to standard output during execution to each target.

=item B<-v>|B<--verify>

Verifies each target before executing any  remote  commands
on  the target. If a target is not responding, execution of
remote commands for the target is canceled.

=item B<-V>|B<--version>

Displays the B<xdcp> command version information.

=head1 B<Environment> B<Variables>

=over 4

=item B<DSH_ENVIRONMENT>

Specifies a file that contains environment variable
definitions to export to the target before executing  the  remote
command. This variable is overridden by the B<-E> flag.

=item B<DSH_FANOUT>

Specifies  the fanout value. This variable is overridden by
the B<-f> flag.

=item B<DSH_NODE_OPTS>

Specifies the options to use for the remote  shell  command
with  node targets only. This variable is overridden by the
B<-o> flag.

=item B<DSH_NODE_RCP>

Specifies the full path of the remote copy command  to  use
to  copy  local scripts and local environment configuration
files to node targets.

=item B<DSH_NODE_RSH>

Specifies the full path of the  remote  shell  to  use  for
remote  command execution on node targets. This variable is
overridden by the B<-r> flag.

=item B<DSH_NODEGROUP_PATH>

Specifies a colon-separated list of directories  that
contain node group files for the B<DSH> context. When the B<-a> flag
is specified in the B<DSH> context,  a  list  of  unique  node
names is collected from all node group files in the path.

=item B<DSH_PATH>

Sets the command path to use on the targets. If B<DSH_PATH> is
not set, the default path defined in  the  profile  of  the
remote I<user_ID> is used.

=item B<DSH_SYNTAX>

Specifies the shell syntax to use on remote targets; B<ksh> or
B<csh>. If not specified, the  B<ksh>  syntax  is  assumed.  This
variable is overridden by the B<-S> flag.

=item B<DSH_TIMEOUT>

Specifies  the  time, in seconds, to wait for output from
each remote target. This variable is overridden by the B<-t> flag.

=back


=head1 B<Exit Status>

Exit  values  for  each  remote copy command execution are displayed in
messages from the xdcp command, if the remote copy command exit value is
non-zero.  A  non-zero return code from a remote copy command indicates
that an error was encountered during the remote copy. If a remote  copy
command  encounters an error, execution of the remote copy on that target is bypassed.

The B<xdcp> command exit code is 0, if  the  B<xdcp>  command  executed  without
errors  and  all remote copy commands finished with exit codes of 0. If
internal B<xdcp> errors occur or the remote copy commands do  not  complete
successfully,  the B<xdcp>  command exit value is greater than 0.



=head1 B<Security>

The  B<xdcp>  command  has no security configuration requirements.  All
remote command security requirements  -  configuration,
authentication,  and authorization - are imposed by the underlying remote
command configured for B<xdsh>. The command  assumes  that  authentication
and  authorization  is  configured  between  the  local host and the
remote targets. Interactive password prompting is not supported;  an
error  is displayed and execution is bypassed for a remote target if
password prompting occurs, or if either authorization or
authentication  to  the  remote  target fails. Security configurations as they
pertain to the remote environment and remote shell command are
userdefined.
