=head1 NAME

B<clonevm> - Create masters from virtual machines and virtual machines from masters.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<clonevm noderange [ -t <mastertobemade> | -b <master to base vms upon> ]  -d|--detached -f|--force>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command to promote a VM's current configuration and storage to a master as well as 
performing the converse operation of creating VMs based on a master.

By default, attempting to create a master from a running VM will produce an error. 
The force argument will request that a master be made of the VM anyway.

Also, by default a VM that is used to create a master will be rebased as a thin 
clone of that master. If the force argument is used to create a master of a powered
on vm, this will not be done.  Additionally, the detached option can be used to 
explicitly request that a clone not be tethered to a master image, allowing the 
clones to not be tied to the health of a master, at the cost of additional storage.

When promoting a VM's current state to master, all rleated virtual disks will be 
copied and merged with any prerequisite images.  A master will not be tethered to
other masters.
