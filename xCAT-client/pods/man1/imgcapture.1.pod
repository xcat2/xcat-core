=head1 NAME

B<imgcapture> - Captures an image from a Linux diskful node and create a diskless or diskful image on the management node.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<imgcapture> node B<-t>|B<--type> {diskless|sysclone} B<-o>|B<--osimage> I<osimage> [B<-V>|B<--verbose>]

B<imgcapture> [B<-h> | B<--help>] | [B<-v> | B<--version>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<imgcapture> command will capture an image from one running diskful Linux node and create a diskless or diskful image for later use.

The B<node> should be one diskful Linux node, managed by the xCAT MN, and the remote shell between MN and the B<node> should have been configured. AIX is not supported. 

The B<imgcapture> command supports two image types: B<diskless> and B<sysclone>. For the B<diskless> type, it will capture an image from one running diskful Linux node, prepares the rootimg directory, kernel and initial rmadisks for the B<liteimg>/B<packimage> command to generate the statelite/stateless rootimg. For the B<sysclone> type, it will capture an image from one running diskful Linux node, create an osimage which can be used to clone other diskful Linux nodes.

The B<diskless> type:

The attributes of osimage will be used to capture and prepare the root image. The B<osver>, B<arch> and B<profile> attributes for the stateless/statelite image to be created are duplicated from the B<node>'s attribute. If the B<-p|--profile> I<profile> option is specified, the image will be created under "/<I<installroot>>/netboot/<osver>/<arch>/<I<profile>>/rootimg". 

The default files/directories excluded in the image are specified by /opt/xcat/share/xcat/netboot/<os>/<I<profile>>.<osver>.<arch>.imgcapture.exlist; also, you can put your customized file (<I<profile>>.<osver>.<arch>.imgcapture.exlist) to /install/custom/netboot/<osplatform>. The directories in the default I<.imgcapture.exlist> file are necessary to capture image from the diskful Linux node managed by xCAT, please don't remove it.

The image captured will be extracted into the /<I<installroot>>/netboot/<B<osver>>/<B<arch>>/<B<profile>>/rootimg directory. 

After the B<imgcapture> command returns without any errors, you can customize the rootimg and run the B<liteimg>/B<packimage> command with the options you want.

The B<sysclone> type:

xCAT leverages the Open Source Tool - Systemimager to capture the osimage from the B<node>, and put it into /<I<installroot>>/B<sysclone>/B<images> directory.

The B<imgcapture> command will create the I<osimage> definition after the image is captured successfully, you can use this osimage and B<nodeset> command to clone diskful nodes.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-t>|B<--type>

Specify the osimage type you want to capture, two types are supported: diskless and sysclone.

=item B<-p|--profile> I<profile> 

Assign I<profile> as the profile of the image to be created.

=item B<-o|--osimage> I<osimage>

The osimage name.

=item B<-i> I<nodebootif>

The network interface the diskless node will boot over (e.g. eth0), which is used by the B<genimage> command to generate initial ramdisks.

This is optional.

=item B<-n> I<nodenetdrivers>

The driver modules needed for the network interface, which is used by the B<genimage> command to generate initial ramdisks.

This is optional. By default, the B<genimage> command can provide drivers for the following network interfaces:

For x86 or x86_64 platform:

    tg3 bnx2 bnx2x e1000 e1000e igb m1x_en

For ppc64 platform:

    e1000 e1000e igb ibmveth ehea

For S390x:

    qdio ccwgroup

If the network interface is not in the above list, you'd better specify the driver modules with this option.

=item B<-h|--help> 

Display the usage message.

=item B<-v|--version>

Display the version.

=item B<-V|--verbose>

Verbose output.

=head1 RETRUN VALUE

0 The command completed sucessfully.

1 An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

B<node1> is one diskful Linux node, which is managed by xCAT.

1. There's one pre-defined I<osimage>. In order to capture and prepare the diskless root image for I<osimage>, run the command:

imgcapture node1 -t diskless -o osimage

2. In order to capture the diskful image from B<node1> and create the I<osimage> B<img1>, run the command:

imgcapture node1 -t sysclone -o img1
