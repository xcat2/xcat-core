=head1 NAME

B<pping> - parallel ping the nodes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pping> [B<-i>|B<--interface> I<interfaces>] [B<-f>|B<--use_fping>] I<noderange>

B<pping> [B<-h>|B<--help>]

B<pping> {B<-v>|B<--version>}


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pping> is a utility used to ping a list of nodes in parallel.
B<pping> will return an unsorted list of nodes with a ping or noping status.
B<pping> front-ends nmap or fping if available.

This command does not support the xcatd client/server communication.  It must be run on the management node.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 10

=item B<-i>|B<--interface> I<interfaces>

A comma separated list of network interface names that should be pinged instead of the interface represented by the nodename/hostname.
The following name resolution convention is assumed:  an interface is reachable by the hostname <nodename>-<interface>.  For example,
the ib2 interface on node3 has a hostname of node3-ib2.

If more than one interface is specified, each interface will be combined with the nodenames as described above and will be pinged in turn.

=item B<-f>|B<--use_fping>

Use fping instead of nmap

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Show usage information.

=item B<-v>|B<--version>

Display the installed version of xCAT.

=item 2.

 pping all -i ib0,ib1

Output is similar to:

 node1-ib0: ping
 node2-ib0: ping
 node3-ib0: noping
 node1-ib1: ping
 node2-ib1: ping
