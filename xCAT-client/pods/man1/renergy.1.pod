=head1 B<DESCRIPTION>

This B<renergy> command can be used to manage the energy consumption of
IBM servers which support IBM EnergyScale technology. Through this command, 
user can query and set the power saving and power capping status, and also can 
query the average consumed energy, the ambient and exhaust temperature, 
the processor frequency for a server.

B<renergy> command supports IBM POWER6, POWER7 and POWER8 rack-mounted servers,
BladeCenter management modules, blade servers, and iDataPlex servers. 
For I<Power6> and I<Power7> rack-mounted servers, the following specific hardware types are supported:
I<8203-E4A>, I<8204-E8A>, I<9125-F2A>, I<8233-E8B>, I<8236-E8C>.
For I<Power8> server, there's no hardware type restriction.

The parameter I<noderange> needs to be specified for the B<renergy> command to 
get the target servers. The I<noderange> should be a list of CEC node names, blade 
management module node names or blade server node names. Lpar name
is not acceptable here.

B<renergy> command can accept multiple of energy attributes to query or one of energy 
attribute to set. If only the attribute name is specified, without the '=', B<renergy> 
gets and displays the current value. Otherwise, if specifying the attribute with '=' like 
'savingstatus=on', B<renergy> will set the attribute savingstatus to value 'on'. 

The attributes listed in the B<SYNOPSIS> section are which ones can be handled by 
B<renergy> command. But for each specific type of server, there are some attributes that
are not supported. If user specifies an attribute which is not supported by a specific
server, the return value of this attribute will be 'na'.

The supported attributes for each specific system p hardware type is listed as follows:

Note:
For system P CEC nodes, each query operation for attribute CPUspeed, averageAC 
or averageDC needs about 30 seconds to complete. The query for others attributes
will get response immediately.

=head1 B<PREREQUISITES>

For the I<Power6> and I<Power7> nodes, the B<renergy> command depends 
on the Energy Management Plugin B<xCAT-pEnergy> to 
communicate with server.  B<xCAT-pEnergy> can be downloaded from the IBM web site: 
http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/. (Other Software -> EM)

NOTE: I<Power8> nodes don't need this specific energy management package.

For iDataPlex nodes, the B<renergy> command depends 
on the Energy Management Plugin B<xCAT-xEnergy> to 
communicate with server.  This plugin must be requested from IBM.

(The support for BladeCenter energy management is built into base xCAT,
so no additional plugins are needed for BladeCenter.)

Note: For 9125-F2A,9125-F2C server, the value of attribute 
averageAC is the aggregate for all of the servers in a rack.

Note: For Blade Center, the value of attribute 
averageAC is the total AC power being consumed by all modules
 in the chassis. It also includes power consumed by the Chassis 
Cooling Devices for BCH chassis.

enabled, but capping disabled.

dynamicPowerMeasurement1: the module with power meter capability, measurement 
enabled, phase 1 only

Query the Minimum of power capping value in watts.

=item B<cappingperc>=B<percentage>

Set the power capping value base on the percentage of 
the max-min of capping value which getting from 
I<cappingmaxmim> attribute. The valid value must be 
from 0 to 100.

=item B<cappingsoftmin>

Query the minimum value that can be assigned to power 
capping without guaranteed enforceability. (Unit is watt)

=item B<cappingstatus>

Query the power capping status. The result should be 'on' 
or 'off'.

=item B<cappingstatus>={B<on> | B<off>}

Set the power capping status. The value must be 'on' 
or 'off'. This is the switch to turn on or turn off the 
power capping function.

=item B<cappingvalue>

Query the current power capping value. (Unit is watt)

=item B<cappingwatt>=B<watt>

Set the power capping value base on the watt unit.

If the 'watt' >  maximum of I<cappingmaxmin> or 'watt' 
< I<cappingsoftmin>, the setting operation 
will be failed. If the 'watt' > I<cappingsoftmin> and 
'watt' < minimum of I<cappingmaxmin>, the value can NOT be 
guaranteed.

Query the effective processor frequency. (Unit is MHz)

=item B<CPUspeedhistory>

Query the historical records which were generated in last one hour for B<CPUspeed>

=item B<dsavingstatus>

Query the dynamic power saving status. The result should 
be 'on-norm', 'on-maxp'  or 'off'. 

If turning on the dynamic power saving, the processor 
frequency and voltage will be dropped dynamically based on 
the core utilization. It supports two modes for turn on state: 

I<on-norm> - means normal, the processor frequency cannot 
exceed the nominal value; 

I<on-maxp> - means maximum performance, the processor 
frequency can exceed the nominal value.

=item B<dsavingstatus>={B<on-norm> | B<on-maxp> | B<off>}

Set the dynamic power saving. The value must be 'on-norm', 
'on-maxp' or 'off'.

The dsavingstatus setting operation needs about 2 minutes 
to take effect. (The used time depends on the hardware type)

The B<dsavingstatus> only can be turned on when the 
B<savingstatus> is in turn off status.

appended after B<fanspped> attribute name.

=item B<fanspeedhistory>

=item B<ffoMin>

Frequency Override)

=item B<ffoNorm>

=item B<ffoTurbo>

Query the advertised maximum cpu frequency (selling point). 

=item B<ffoVmin>

Query the minimum cpu frequency which can be set for dropping down 
the voltage to save power. That means when you drop the cpu 
frequency from the ffoVmin to ffoVmin, the voltage won't change, 
then there's no obvious power to be saved.

=item B<ffovalue>

Query the current value of FFO.

=item B<ffovalue>=B<MHZ>

Set the current value of FFO. The valid value of ffovalue should 
be between the ffoMin and ffoNorm.

Note1: Due to the limitation of firmware, the frequency in the range 
3501 MHz - 3807 MHz can NOT be set to ffovalue. This range may be 
changed in future.

Note2: The setting will take effect only when the fsavingstatus is in 
'on' status. But you need to set the ffovalue to a valid value before 
enabling the fsavingstatus. (It's a limitation of the initial firmware 
and will be fixed in future.) 

The ffovalue setting operation needs about 1 minute to take effect.

=item B<fsavingstatus>

Query the status of FFO. The result should be 'on' or 'off'. 
'on' - enable; 'off' - disable.

=item B<fsavingstatus>={B<on> | B<off>}

Set the status of FFO. The value must be 'on' or 'off'.

'on' - enable. It will take effect only when the B<ffovalue> 
has been set to a valid value.

'off' -disable. It will take effect immediately.

Note: See the Note2 of ffovalue=MHZ.

=item B<savingstatus>={B<on> | B<off>}

Set the static power saving. The value must be 'on' or 'off'. 

If turning on the static power saving, the processor frequency 
and voltage will be dropped to a fixed value to save energy.

The savingstatus setting operation needs about 2 minutes to 
take effect. (The used time depends on the hardware type)

The B<savingstatus> only can be turned on when the 
B<dsavingstatus> is in turn off status.
