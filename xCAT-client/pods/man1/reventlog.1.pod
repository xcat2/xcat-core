B<reventlog> - retrieve or clear remote hardware event logs

=head1 B<Synopsis>

B<reventlog> I<noderange> [I<number-of-entries> [B<-s>]|B<all [-s]>|B<clear>]

B<reventlog> [B<-h>|B<--help>|B<-v>|B<--version>]

=head2 OpenPOWER OpenBMC specific :

B<reventlog> I<noderange> [B<resolved=>{I<id-list>|B<LED>}]


=head1 B<Description>

B<reventlog>  can  display any number of remote hardware event log entries
or clear them for a range of nodes.  Hardware  event
logs are stored on each servers service processor.

=head1 B<Options>

=over 7

=item I<number-of-entries>

Retrieve the specified number of entries from the nodes' service processors.

=item B<all>

Retrieve all entries.

=item B<-s>

To sort the entries from latest (always the last entry in event DB) to oldest (always the first entry in event DB). If B<number-of-entries> specified, the latest B<number-of-entries> events will be output in the order of latest to oldest.

=item B<clear>

Clear event logs.

=item B<resolved=>{I<id-list>|B<LED>}

Mark event log entries as resolved. Use comma separated list of entry ids to specify individual entries. Use B<LED> to mark as resolved all event log entries that contribute to LED fault.

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Print help.

=item B<-v>|B<--version>

Print version.

=head1 B<Examples>

=over 2

=item 1.
List last 5 event log entries from node4 and node5

 reventlog node4,node5 5

Output is similar to:

 node4: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:23:33 Remote Login Successful User ID = USERID[00]
 node4: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:23:32 System spn1 started a RS485 connection with us[00]
 node4: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:22:35 RS485 connection to system spn1 has ended[00]
 node4: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:22:32 Remote Login Successful User  ID  = USERID[00]
 node4: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:22:31 System spn1 started a RS485 connection with us[00]
 node5: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:22:32 Remote Login Successful User  ID  = USERID[00]
 node5: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:22:31 System spn1 started a RS485 connection with us[00]
 node5: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:21:34 RS485 connection to system spn1 has ended[00]
 node5: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:21:30 Remote Login Successful User ID = USERID[00]
 node5: SERVPROC I 09/06/00 15:21:29 System spn1 started a RS485 connection with us[00]

=item 2.
Clear all event log entries from node4 and node5

 reventlog node4,node5 clear

Output is similar to:

 node4: clear
 node5: clear

=item 3.
Mark as resolved all event log entries from node4 that contribute to LED fault

 reventlog node4 resolved=LED

Output is similar to:

 Attempting to resolve the following log entries: LED...
 node4: Resolved 51.
 node4: Resolved 52.
 node4: Resolved 58.
