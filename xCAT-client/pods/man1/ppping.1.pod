=head1 NAME

B<ppping> - parallel ping from nodes to other nodes in the cluster.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ppping> [B<-i>|B<--interface> I<interfaces>] [B<-d>|B<--debug>] [B<-V>|B<--verbose>] [B<-q>|B<--quiet>] [B<-s>|B<--serial>] I<noderange>

B<ppping> [B<-h>|B<--help>]

B<pping> {B<-v>|B<--version>}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ppping> is a utility used to test the connectivity between nodes in the noderange using ping.
By default, B<ppping> will return an unsorted list of the node pairs that are not able to ping each other, or a message that all nodes are pingable.
More or less output can be controlled by the -V and -q options.
B<ppping> front-ends B<pping> and B<xdsh>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 10

=item B<-s>

Ping serially instead of in parallel.

=item B<-i>|B<--interface> I<interfaces>

A comma separated list of network interface names that should be pinged instead of the interface represented by the nodename/hostname.
The following name resolution convention is assumed:  an interface is reachable by the hostname <nodename>-<interface>.  For example,
the ib2 interface on node3 has a hostname of node3-ib2.

If more than one interface is specified, each interface will be combined with the nodenames as described above and will be pinged in turn.

=item B<-V>|B<--verbose>

Display verbose output.  The result of every ping attempt from every node will be displayed.  Without this option, just a summary
of the successful pings are displayed, along with all of the unsuccessful pings.

=item B<-q>|B<--quiet>

Display minimum output:  just the unsuccessful pings.  This option has the effect that if all pings are successful, nothing is displayed.
But it also has the performance benefit that each node does not have to send successful ping info back to the management node.

=item B<-d>|B<--debug>

Print debug information.

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Show usage information.

=item B<-v>|B<--version>

Display the installed version of xCAT.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

 ppping all -q

Output is similar to:

 blade7: node2: noping
 blade8: node2: noping
 blade9: node2: noping
 devmaster: node2: noping
 node2: noping

=item 2.

 ppping node1,node2 -i ib0,ib1,ib2,ib3

Output is similar to:

 node1: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib0
 node1: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib1
 node1: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib2
 node1: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib3
 node2: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib0
 node2: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib1
 node2: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib2
 node2: pinged all nodes successfully on interface ib3
