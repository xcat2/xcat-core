B<rcons> [B<-h>|B<--help>|B<-v>|B<--version>]

=head1 B<Description>

B<rcons> provides access to a single remote node serial console, using the out-of-band infrastructure for the node
(e.g. BMC, Management Module, HMC, KVM, etc.).  It uses the conserver open source package to provide one read-write and
multiple read-only instances of the console, plus console logging.

If I<conserver-host> is specified, the conserver daemon on that host will be contacted, instead of on the local host.

To exit the console session, enter:  <ctrl><shift>e c .

=over 5

=item B<-f>

If another console for this node is already open in read-write mode, force that console into read-only (spy) mode, and
open this console in read-write mode.  If -f is not specified, this console will be put in spy mode if another console
is already open in read-write mode. The -f flag can not be used with the -s flag.

=item B<-s>

Open the console in read-only (spy) mode, in this mode all the escape sequences work, but all other keyboard input is 
discarded. The -s flag can not be used with the -f flag. 

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Print help.

=item B<-v>|B<--version>

Print version.
