=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to remove xCAT object definitions that are stored in the xCAT database.


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 10

=item B<-a|--all>

Clear the whole xCAT database. A backup of the xCAT definitions should be saved before using this option as the xCAT daemons will no longer work once cleared.

To restore: 

=over 5

=item 1. B<export XCATBYPASS=1> and run the B<restorexCATdb> command.  

or 

=item 2. Run B<xcatconfig -d> which initializes the database the same as when xCAT was installed. 

=back

=item B<-f|--force>

Use this with the B<--all> option as an extra indicator that ALL definitions are to be removed.

=item B<-h|--help>

Display a usage message.

=item I<noderange>

=item B<-t> I<object-types>
