=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rmdef> [B<-h>|B<--help>] [B<-t> I<object-types>]

B<rmdef> [B<-V>|B<--verbose>] [B<-a>|B<--all>] [B<-t> I<object-types>] [B<-o> I<object-names>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to remove xCAT object definitions that are stored in the xCAT database.


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 10

=item B<-a|--all>

Clear the whole xCAT database. A backup of the xCAT definitions should be saved before using this option.  Once all the data is removed the xCAT daemon will no longer work and you will have to switch to bypass mode in order to restore your data. You can switch to bypass mode by setting the XCATBYPASS environmant variable.  (ex. "export XCATBYPASS=yes") 

=item B<-f|--force>

Use this with the all option as an extra indicator that ALL definitions are to be removed.

=item B<-h|--help>

Display a usage message.

=item I<noderange>

A set of comma delimited node names and/or group names. See the "noderange" man page for details on supported formats.

=item B<-o> I<object-names>

A set of comma delimited object names.

=item B<-t> I<object-types>

A set of comma delimited object types.

=item B<-V|--verbose>

Verbose mode.
