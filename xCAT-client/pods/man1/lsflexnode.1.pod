=head1 NAME

B<lsflexnode> - Display the information of flexible node


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<lsflexnode> [B<-h> | B<--help>]

B<lsflexnode> [B<-v> | B<--version>]

B<lsflexnode> I<noderange> 


=head1 DESCRIPTION

IBM BladeCenter HX5 offers flexibility ideal that the blades can be combined together for scalability. 

There are several concepts to support the HX5 multiple blades combination:

=over 2

B<Complex>: Multiple blades which combined by a scalability card is a complex. 

B<Parition>: A logic concept which containing part of the B<Blade slot node> in a complex. Each partition can map to a system to install Operating System. Each partition could have 1HX5, 1HX5+1MD or 2HX5+2MD. (MD is the Memory Drawer)

B<Blade slot node>: The physical blade which installed in the slot of a chassis. It can be a HX5 or MD.

=back

A B<Complex> will be created automatically when a multiple blades combination is installed. In this B<Complex>, every blade belongs to it is working as a B<Blade slot node>. 

A B<Partition> can be created base on the B<Complex>, each B<Partition> can have one or multiple B<Blade slot node>.

The I<noderange> in the B<SYNOPSIS> can be a AMM node or a blade node.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The meaning of attributes which displayed by the B<lsflexnode>. The word 'node' in this section means B<Blade slot node>.

=over 4

=item B<Complex>  

The unique numeric identifier for a complex installed in the chassis.

=item B<Partition number>

The number of partitions currently defined for this complex.

=item B<Complex node number>

The number of nodes existing in this complex, regardless of their assignment to any given partition.

=item B<Partition>

The unique numeric identifier for a partition defined within a complex installed in the chassis.

=item B<Partition Mode>

The currently configured mode of this partition. It can be 'partition' or 'standalone'.

=item B<Partition node number>

The number of nodes currently defined for this partition.

=item B<Partition status>

The current power status of this partition when the partition has a valid partition configuration. It can be 'poweredoff', 'poweredon', 'resetting' or 'invalid'.

=item B<Node>

The unique numeric identifier for this node, unique within the partition. If this node does not belong to a partition, the slot number will be displayed.

=item B<Node state>

The physical power state of this node. It can be 'poweredoff', 'poweredon' or 'resetting'.

=item B<Node slot>

The base slot number where the node exists in the chassis.

=item B<Node resource>

A string providing a summary overview of the resources provided by this node. It includes the CPU number, CPU frequency and Memory size.

=item B<Node type>

The general categorization of the node. It can be 'processor', 'memory' or 'io'.

=item B<Node role>

Indicates if the node is assigned to a partition, and if so, provides an indication of whether the node is the primary node of the partition or not.

=item B<Flexnode state>

The state of a flexible node. It is the state of the partition which this node belongs to. If this node does NOT belong to a partition, the value should be 'invalid'.

It can be 'poweredoff', 'poweredon', 'resetting' or 'invalid'.

=item B<Complex id>

The identifier of the complex this node belongs to.

=item B<Partition id>

The identifier of the partition this node belongs to.
