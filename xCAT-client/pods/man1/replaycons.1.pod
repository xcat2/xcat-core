=head1 NAME

B<replaycons> - replay the console output for a node


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<replaycons> [I<node>] [I<bps>] [I<tail_amount>]

B<replaycons> [B<-h> | B<--help> | B<-v> | B<--version>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<replaycons> command reads the console log stored by conserver for this node, and displays it
in a way that simulates the original output of the console.  Using the I<bps> value, it will throttle
the speed of the output play back.  (The conserver logs are stored in /var/log/consoles.)

For now, replaycons must be run locally on the system on which the console log is stored.  This is normally
that management node, but in a hierarchical cluster will usually be the service node.
