=head1 EXAMPLES

1. To remove a kit component from osimage

rmkitcomp -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64

Output is similar to:

kitcomponents comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 were removed from osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute successfully

2. To remove a kit component even it is still used as a dependency of other kit component.

rmkitcomp -f -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64

Output is similar to:

kitcomponents comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 were removed from osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute successfully

3. To remove a kit component from osimage and also remove the kit component meta RPM and package RPM.  So in next genimage for statelss image and updatenode for statefull nodes, the kit component meta RPM and package RPM will be uninstalled.

rmkitcomp -u -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64

Output is similar to:

kitcomponents comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 were removed from osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute successfully
