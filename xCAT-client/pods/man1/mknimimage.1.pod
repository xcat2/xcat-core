B<mknimimage [-V] [-f|--force] [-r|--sharedroot] [-D|--mkdumpres] [-l> I<location>] [B<-c>|B<--completeosimage>] [B<-s> I<image_source>] [B<-i> I<current_image>] [B<-p>|B<--cplpp>] [B<-t> I<nimtype>] [B<-m> I<nimmethod>] [B<-n> I<mksysbnode>] [B<-b> I<mksysbfile>] I<osimage_name> [I<attr=val [attr=val ...]>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command will create both an xCAT osimage definition and the corresponding NIM resource definitions. The command can also be used to update an existing AIX diskless image(SPOT).

The command will also install the NIM master software and configure NIM if needed.

The naming convention for the NIM SPOT resource definition is to use the same name as the xCAT osimage.  The naming convention for any other NIM resources that are created is "<osimage_name>_<resource_type>". (ex. "61image_lpp_source" )

When creating a mksysb image definition you must specify either the "-n" or the "-b" option. The "-n" option can be used to create a mksysb image from an existing NIM client machine.  The "-b" option can be used to specify an existing mksysb backup file.

B<Adding software and configuration files to the osimage.>

When creating a diskless osimage definition you also have the option of automatically updating the NIM SPOT resource.  You can have additional software installed or you can have configuration files added or updated.  To have software installed you must provide either the names of NIM installp_bundle resources or fileset names on the command line using the "attr=val" option. You may also supply the installp flags, RPM flags, emgr flags to use when installing the software. 

To have configuration files updated you must provide the full path name of a "synclists" file which contains the the list of actual files to update.  The xCAT osimage definition that is created will contain the installp_bundle, otherpkgs, and synclists files that are provided on the command line.

B<Updating an existing xCAT osimage>

If you wish to update an existing diskless image after it has already been created you can use the "-u" (update) option.  In this case the xCAT osimage definition will not be updated. 

There are two ways to use the update feature.  

You can update the osimage definition and run the B<mknimimage> command with no "installp_bundle", "otherpkgs", or "synclists" command line values. The information for updating the SPOT will come from the osimage definition only.  This has the advantage of keeping a record of any changes that were made to the SPOT. 

Or, you could do a more ad hoc update by providing one or more of the "installp_bundle", "otherpkgs", or "synclists" values on the command line. If any of these values are provided the B<mknimimage> command will use those values only. The osimage definition will not be used or updated.

WARNING: Installing random RPM packages in a SPOT may have unpredictable consequences.  The SPOT is a very restricted environment and some RPM packages may corrupt the SPOT or even hang your management system.  Try to be very careful about the packages you install. When installing RPMs, if the mknimimage command hangs or if there are file systems left mounted after the command completes you may need to reboot your management node to recover.  This is a limitation of the current AIX support for diskless systems

B<Copying an xCAT osimage.>

You can use the "-i" and "-p" options to copy an existing diskless osimage.   To do this you must supply the name of an existing xCAT osimage definition and the name of the new osimage you wish to create. The B<mknimimage> command will do the following:

- create a new xCAT osimage definition using the new name that was specified.

- copy the NIM SPOT resource to a new location and define it to NIM using a new name.

- if the original osimage included a NIM "shared_root" resource then a new shared_root resource will be created for the new SPOT.

- any other resources (or attributes) included in the original osimage will be included in the new osimage definition.

- if the "-p" option is specified then the original NIM lpp_source resource will be copied to a new location and redfined to NIM. (The default would be to use the original lpp_source - to save file system space.)


B<Additional information>

IMPORTANT:  The NIM lpp_source and SPOT resources can get quite large. Always make sure that you have sufficient file system space available before running the B<mknimimage> command.

To list the contents of the xCAT osimage definition use the xCAT B<lsdef> command ("lsdef -t osimage -l -o <osimage_name>").

To check the validity of a SPOT or lpp_source resource

To remove an xCAT osimage definition along with the associated NIM resource definitions use the B<rmnimimage> command. Be careful not to accidently remove NIM resources if they are still needed.

To list a NIM resource definition use the AIX B<lsnim> command ("lsnim -l <resource_name>").

To check the validity of a SPOT or lpp_source resource use the AIX B<nim> command ("nim -o check <resourec-name>").

To remove specific NIM resource definitons use the AIX B<nim> command. ("nim -o remove <resource-name>").

=head1 RETURN VALUE

=over 3

=item 0.
The command completed successfully.

=item 1.
An error has occurred.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

1) Create an osimage definition and the basic NIM resources needed to do a NIM "standalone" "rte" installation of node "node01".  Assume the software contained on the AIX product media has been copied to the /AIX/instimages directory.

 mknimimage -s /AIX/instimages  61image

2) Create an osimage definition that includes some additional NIM resources.

 mknimimage -s /AIX/instimages 61image installp_bundle=mybndlres,addswbnd

This command will create lpp_source, spot, and bosinst_data resources using the source specified by the "-s" option.  The installp_bundle information will also be included in the osimage definition.  The mybndlres and addswbnd resources must be created before using this osimage definition to install a node.

3) Create an osimage definition that includes a mksysb image and related resources.

 mknimimage -m mksysb -n node27 newsysb spot=myspot bosinst_data=mybdata

This command will use node27 to create a mksysb backup image and use that to define a NIM mksysb resource. The osimage definition will contain the name of the mksysb resource as well as the spot and bosinst_data resource.

4) Create an osimage definition using a mksysb image provided on the command line.

 mknimimage -m mksysb -b /tmp/backups/mysysbimage newsysb spot=myspot bosinst_data=mybdata

This command defines a NIM mksysb resource using mysysbimage.

5) Create an osimage definition and create the required spot definition using the mksysb backup file provided on the command line.

 mknimimage -m mksysb -b /tmp/backups/mysysbimage newsysb bosinst_data=mybdata

This command defines a NIM mksysb resource and a spot definition using mysysbimage.

6) Create a diskless image called 61dskls using the AIX source files provided in the /AIX/instimages directory.

 mknimimage -t diskless -s /AIX/instimages 61dskls

7) Create a diskless image called "614dskls" that includes a NIM "shared_root" and a "dump" resource.  Use the existing NIM lpp_resource called "614_lpp_source". Also specify verbose output.

 mknimimage -V -r -D -t diskless -s 614_lpp_source 614dskls snapcollect=yes

The "snapcollect" attribute specifies that AIX "snap" data should be include when a system dump is initiated.

8) Create a new diskless image by copying an existing image.

 mknimimage -t diskless -i 61cosi 61cosi_updt1

Note:  If you also wish to have the original lpp_source copied and defined use the -p option.

 mknimimage -t diskless -i 61cosi -p 61cosi_updt1

9) Create a diskless image using an existing lpp_source resource named "61cosi_lpp_source" and include NIM tmp and home resources.  This assumes that the "mytmp" and "myhome" NIM resources have already been created by using NIM commands.

 mknimimage -t diskless -s 61cosi_lpp_source 611cosi tmp=mytmp home=myhome

10) Create a diskless image and update it with additional software using rpm flags and configuration files. 

 mknimimage -t diskless -s 61cosi_lpp_source 61dskls otherpkgs=I:fset1,R:foo.rpm,E:IZ38930TL0.120304.epkg.Z synclists=/install/mysyncfile rpm_flags="-i --nodeps"

The xCAT osimage definition created by this command will include the "otherpkgs" and "synclists" values.  The NIM SPOT resource associated with this osimage will be updated with the additional software using rpm flags "-i --nodeps" and configuration files.

11) Update an existing diskless image (AIX/NIM SPOT) using the information saved in the xCAT "61dskls" osimage definition. Also specify verbose messages.  

 mknimimage -V -u 61dskls

12) Update an existing diskless image called "61dskls".  Install the additional software specified in the NIM "bndres1" and "bndres2" installp_bundle resources using the installp flags "-agcQX".  (The NIM "bndres1" and "bndres2" definitions must be created before using them in this command.)

 mknimimage -u 61dskls installp_bundle=bndres1,bndres2 installp_flags="-agcQX"

Note that when "installp_bundle", "otherpkgs", or "synclists" values are specified with the "-u" option then the xCAT osimage definiton is not used or updated.

13) Update an existing image to support NFSv4. Also specify verbose messages.  

 mknimimage -V -u 61dskls nfs_vers=4
