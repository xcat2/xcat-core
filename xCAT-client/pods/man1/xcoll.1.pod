standard  output. Assume that the output from node3 and node4
is identical:

 ====================================
 node1 or nodegroup name
 ====================================
 .
 .
 lines from psh for node1 with hostnames stripped off
 .
 .

 ====================================
 node2 or nodegroup name
 ====================================
