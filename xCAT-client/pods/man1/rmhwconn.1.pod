=head1 NAME

B<rmhwconn> - Use this command to remove connections from CEC and Frame nodes to HMC nodes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rmhwconn> [B<-h>| B<--help>]

B<rmhwconn> [B<-v>| B<--version>]

=head2 PPC (with HMC) specific:

B<rmhwconn> [B<-V>| B<--verbose>] I<noderange>

=head2 PPC (without HMC, using FSPAPI) specific:

B<rmhwconn> I<noderange> B<-T> I<tooltype>

=head2 PPC (use HMC as SFP) specific:

B<rmhwconn> B<-s>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For PPC (with HMC) specific:

This command is used to disconnect CEC and Frame nodes from HMC nodes, according to the connection information defined in ppc talbe in xCAT DB. 

Note: If a CEC belongs to a frame with a BPA installed, this CEC cannot be disconnected individually. Instead, the whole frame should be disconnected.

For PPC (without HMC, using FSPAPI) specific:

It's used to disconnection CEC and Frame nodes from hardware server.

For PPC (use HMC as SFP) specific:

It is used to disconnect Frame nodes from HMC nodes.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-h|--help>

Display usage message.

=item B<-V|--verbose>

Verbose output.

=item B<-T>

The tooltype is used to communicate to the CEC/Frame. The value could be B<lpar> or B<fnm>. The tooltype value B<lpar> is for xCAT and B<fnm> is for CNM.

=back


=head1 RETURN VALUE

0 The command completed successfully.

1 An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

To disconnect all CEC nodes in node group cec from their HMC nodes:

 rmhwconn cec

=item 2.

To remove the connection for Frame node frame1:

 rmhwconn frame1

=item 3.

To disconnect all CEC nodes in node group cec from their related hardware serveri, using lpar tooltype:
 
 rmhwconn cec -T lpar

=back


=head1 FILES

$XCATROOT/bin/rmhwconn

(The XCATROOT environment variable is set when xCAT is installed. The
default value is "/opt/xcat".)

=head1 NOTES

This command is part of the xCAT software product.
