=head1 NAME

B<nodels> - lists the nodes, and their attributes, from the xCAT database.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<nodels> [I<noderange>] [B<-b> | B<--blame>] [B<-H> | B<--with-fieldname>] [B<-S>] [I<table.column> | I<shortname>] [I<...>]  

B<nodels> [I<noderange>] [B<-H> | B<--with-fieldname>] [I<table>]

B<nodels> [B<-?> | B<-h> | B<--help> | B<-v> | B<--version>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<nodels> command lists the nodes specified in the node range. If no noderange is provided, then all nodes are listed.

Additional attributes of the nodes will also be displayed if the table names and attribute names
are specified after the noderange in the form:  I<table.column> .  A few shortcut names can
also be used as aliases to common attributes:

=over 15

=item B<groups>

nodelist.groups

=item B<tags>

nodelist.groups

=item B<mgt>

nodehm.mgt

=back

nodels can also select based on table value criteria. The following operators are available: 

=over 15

=item B<==>

Select nodes where the table.column value is exactly a certain value.

=item B<!=>

Select nodes where the table.column value is not a given specific value.

=item B<=~>

Select nodes where the table.column value matches a given regular expression.

=item B<!~>

Select nodes where the table.column value does not match a given regular expression.

=back

The B<nodels> command with a specific node and one or more table.attribute parameters is a good substitute
for grep'ing through the tab files, as was typically done in xCAT 1.x.  This is because nodels will translate
any regular expression rows in the tables into their meaning for the specified node.  The tab* commands
will not do this, instead they will just display the regular expression row verbatim.
