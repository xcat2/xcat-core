=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rpower> controls the power for a single or range of nodes,  via the out-of-band path.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<on>

Turn power on.

=item B<onstandby>

Turn power on to standby state

=item B<lowpower>

Turn CEC to low power state (state EOCT). This is a disruptive operation which requires the CEC to be powered off prior to entering low power mode. And we can use power off command to get out of lowepower state.

=item B<rackstandby>

Places the rack in the rack standby state. It requires that all CECs and DE be powered off before it will run.

=item B<exit_rackstandby>

Exit Rack standby will be the default state that a rack goes into when power is initially applied to the rack. It simply moves the BPA from Rack standby to both bpa's in standby state.

=item B<softoff>

Attempt to request clean shutdown of OS (may not detect failures in completing command)

=item B<off>

Turn power off.

=item B<suspend>

Suspend the target nodes execution

=item B<stat>|B<state>

Print the current power state/status.

=item B<reset>

Send a hard reset.

=item B<boot>

If off, then power on.
If on, then hard reset.
This option is recommended over B<cycle>.

=item B<cycle>

Power off, then on.

=item B<of>

Boot the node to open firmware console mode.

=item B<sms>

Boot the node to open firmware SMS menu mode.

=item B<-m> I<table.column>==I<expectedstatus> B<-m> I<table.column>=~I<expectedstatus>

Use one or multiple B<-m> flags to specify the node attributes and the expected status for the node installation monitoring and automatic retry mechanism. The operators ==, !=, =~ and !~ are valid. This flag must be used with -t flag.

Note: if the "val" fields includes spaces or any other characters that will be parsed by shell, the "attr<oper-ator>val" needs to be quoted. If the operator is "!~", the "attr<operator>val" needs to be quoted using single quote.

=item B<--nodeps>

Do not use dependency table (default is to use dependency table). Valid only with B<on|off|boot|reset|cycle> for blade power method and B<on|off|reset|softoff> for hmc/fsp power method.

=item B<-r> I<retrycount>

specify the number of retries that the monitoring process will perform before declare the failure. The default value is 3. Setting the retrycount to 0 means only monitoring the os installation progress and will not re-initiate the installation if the node status has not been changed to the expected value after timeout. This flag must be used with -m flag.

=item B<-t> I<timeout>

Specify the the timeout, in minutes, to wait for the expectedstatus specified by -m flag. This is a required flag if the -m flag is specified.

Power off, then on.

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Prints out a brief usage message.

=item B<-v>|B<--version>

Display the version number.
