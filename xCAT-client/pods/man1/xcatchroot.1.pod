=head1 NAME

B<xcatchroot> - Use this xCAT command to modify an xCAT AIX diskless operating system image.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xcatchroot -h >

B<xcatchroot [-V] -i osimage_name  cmd_string>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For AIX diskless images this command will modify the AIX SPOT resource using 
the chroot command.  You must include the name of an xCAT osimage
definition and the command that you wish to have run in the spot.

WARNING:

=over 3

	Be very careful when using this command!!!  Make sure you are
	very clear about exactly what you are changing so that you do
	not accidently corrupt the image.
	
	As a precaution it is advisable to make a copy of the original
	spot in case your changes wind up corrupting the image.

=back

When you are done updating a NIM spot resource you should always run the NIM
check operation on the spot.

=over 3

	nim -Fo check <spot_name>

=back

The xcatchroot command will take care of any of the required setup so that 
the command you provide will be able to run in the spot chroot environment.
It will also mount the lpp_source resource listed in the osimage definition
so that you can access additional software that you may wish to install.

For example, assume that the location of the spot named in the xCAT osimage 
definition is /install/nim/spot/614spot/usr. The associated root directory in
this spot would be /install/nim/spot/614spot/usr/lpp/bos/inst_root.  The chroot
is automatically done to this new root directory.  The spot location is 
mounted on /.../inst_root/usr so that when your command is run in the chroot
environment it is actually running commands from the spot usr location.

Also, the location of the lpp_source resource specified in the osimage 
definition will be mounted to a subdirectory of the spot /.../inst_root
directory.  For example, if the lpp_source location is 
/install/nim/lpp_source/614lpp_lpp_source then that would be mounted over
/install/nim/spot/614spot/usr/lpp/bos/inst_root/lpp_source.  

When you provide a command string to run make sure you give the full paths
of all commands and files assuming the /.../inst_root directory is you root
directory.  

If you wish to install software from the lpp_source location you would
provide a directory location of /lpp_source (or /lpp_source/installp/ppc 
or /lpp_source/RPMS/ppc etc.) See the example below.

Always run the NIM check operation after you are done updating your spot.
(ex. "nim -o check <spot_name>")

=head1 EXAMPLES

1) Set the root password to "cluster" in the spot so that when the diskless 
node boots it will have a root password set.

B<xcatchroot -i 614spot "/usr/bin/echo root:cluster | /usr/bin/chpasswd -c">

2) Install the bash rpm package.

B<xcatchroot -i 614spot "/usr/bin/rpm -Uvh /lpp_source/RPMS/ppc bash-3.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm">

3) To enable system debug.

B<xcatchroot -i 614spot "bosdebug -D -M">

4) To set the "ipforwarding" system tunable.

B<xcatchroot -i 614spot "/usr/sbin/no -r -o ipforwarding=1">
