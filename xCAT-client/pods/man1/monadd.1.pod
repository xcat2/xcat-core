=head1 NAME

B<monadd> - Registers a monitoring plug-in to the xCAT cluster.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<monadd  [-h| --help]>

I<monadd  [-v| --version]>

I<monadd  name [-n|--nodestatmon] [-s|--settings settings]>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to register a monitoring plug-in module to monitor the xCAT cluster. The plug-in module will be added to the xCAT I<monitoring> database table and the configuration scripts for the monitoring plug-in, if any, will be added to the I<postscripts> table. A monitoring plug-in module acts as a bridge that connects a 3rd party monitoring software and the xCAT cluster. A configuration script is used to configure the 3rd party software. Once added to the <postscripts> table, it will be invoked on the nodes during node deployment stage.


=head1 Parameters

I<name> is the name of the monitoring plug-in module. For example, if the the I<name> is called I<xxx>, then the actual file name that the xcatd looks for is I</opt/xcat/lib/perl/xCAT_monitoring/xxx.pm>. Use I<monls -a> command to list all the monitoring plug-in modules that can be used.

I<settings> is the monitoring plug-in specific settings. It is used to customize the behavior of the plug-in or configure the 3rd party software. Format: I<-s key-value -s key=value ...> Please note that the square brackets are needed here. Use I<monls name -d> command to look for the possbile setting keys for a plug-in module.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 10

=item B<-h | --help>

Display usage message.

=item B<-n | --nodestatmon>

Indicate that this monitoring plug-in will be used for feeding the node liveness status to the xCAT I<nodelist> table.

=item B<-s | --settings>

Specifies the plug-in specific settings. These settings will be used by the plug-in to customize certain entities for the plug-in or the third party monitoring software. e.g. -s mon_interval=10 -s toggle=1.

=item B<-v | --version >

Command Version.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

To register gangliamon plug-in module (which interacts with Ganglia monitoring software) to monitor the xCAT cluster, enter:

  monadd gangliamon

=item 2.

To register rmcmon plug-in module (which interacts with IBM's RSCT monitoring software) to monitor the xCAT cluster and have it feed the node liveness status to xCAT's I<nodelist> table, enter:

  monadd rmcmon -n

This will also add the I<configrmcnode> to the I<postscripts> table. To view the content of the I<postscripts> table, enter:

  tabdump postscritps
  #node,postscripts,comments,disable
  "service","servicenode",,
  "xcatdefaults","syslog,remoteshell,configrmcnode",,

=item 3.

To register xcatmon plug-in module to feed the node liveness status to xCAT's I<nodelist> table, enter:

  monadd xcatmon -n -s ping-interval=2

where 2 is the number of minutes between the pings.
