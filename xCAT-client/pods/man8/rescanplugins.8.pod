=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rescanplugins>

B<rescanplugins> [B<-s>|B<--servicenodes>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rescanplugins> notifies the xcatd daemon to rescan the plugin directory and update its internal command handlers hash.  This command should be used when plugins have been added or removed from the xCAT plugin directory (/opt/xcat/lib/perl/xCAT_plugin) or if the contents of the handled_commands subroutine in an existing plugin has changed.  

If rescanplugins is called as a subrequest from another command, the xcatd command handlers hash changes will not be available to that command's process.  Only subsequent command calls will see the updates.
