=head1 NAME

B<mknb> - creates a network boot root image for node discovery and flashing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mknb> I<arch>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<mknb> command is run by xCAT automatically when xCAT is installed on the management node.
It creates a network boot root image (used for node discovery, BMC programming, and flashing)
for the same architecture that the management node is.  So you normally do not need to run the
B<mknb> command yourself.

If you make custom changes to the network boot root image, you will need to run B<mknb> again to regenerate the diskless image to include your changes.  If you have an xCAT Hierarchical Cluster with Service Nodes having local /tftpboot directories (site.sharedtftp=0), you will need to copy the generated root image to each Service Node.

Presently, the architectures x86_64 and ppc64 are supported. For ppc64le, use the ppc64 architecture.
