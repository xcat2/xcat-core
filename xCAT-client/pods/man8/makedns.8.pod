=head1 NAME

B<makedns> - sets up domain name services (DNS).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<makedns> [I<-h>|I<--help>]

B<makedns> [I<-n>|I<--new>] [I<noderange>]

B<makedns> [I<-d>|I<--delete> I<noderange>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<makedns> configures a DNS server on the local machine from the /etc/hosts file entries if no I<noderange> specified.  It also uses the following
attributes set in the B<site> table as default values:  B<domain>, B<forwarders>, B<nameservers>.
The B<net> and B<mask> attributes in the B<networks> table will also be used.  Only entries in
/etc/hosts or the hosts specified by I<noderange> that are part of a network listed in the B<networks> table will be added to DNS.

B<makedns> can only handle hostnames from a single domain, normally a private domain just for the cluster.  The
typical cluster set up is for site.domain to be set to the cluster domain, site.nameservers to be set to the
cluster-facing IP address of the management node, and site.forwarders to be set to the IP address of one or more
nameservers at your site that can resolve names outside of your cluster.  With this set up, all nodes ask the
management node to resolve names, and if it is a name that the MN DNS does not know about, it will ask the outside
world.
