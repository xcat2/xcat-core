=head1 NAME

B<makedhcp> - Creates new dhcp configuration files and updates live dhcp configuration using omapi.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<makedhcp> B<-n>

B<makedhcp> B<-a>

B<makedhcp> B<-a -d>

B<makedhcp> B<-d> I<noderange>

B<makedhcp> I<noderange> [B<-s> I<statements>]

B<makedhcp> I<noderange> B<--hfi> 

B<makedhcp> [I<-h|--help>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<makedhcp> command configures the DHCP daemon on the local system so that xCAT
can manage the nodes of the cluster during discovery, full install, diskless booting, and normal booting.
With the B<-n> option, B<makedhcp> will create a dhcpd.conf file, including certain general parameters
such as a dynamic range and omapi configuration.
With a noderange or the B<-a> option, makedhcp will inject configuration data (via omapi) pertinent to the
specified nodes that immediately takes effect without a restart of DHCP.

If the B<-d> flag is used with the B<-a> flag then it will delete all nodes' dhcp host definitions.
The B<-d> flag followed by a I<noderange> will delete the dhcp host definitons for the noderange.

The B<makedhcp> command also uses the following attributes from the xCAT database:
B<site.dhcpinterfaces>, B<site.domain>, B<networks.dynamicrange>, B<networks.dhcpserver>.  See
the xcatdb man page for details about the database attributes.

Note: This command is not supported for AIX clusters.


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 12

=item B<-n>

Create a new dhcpd.conf file with a network statement for each network dhcpd should listen on.
The B<makedhcp> command will automatically restart dhcpd after this operation.

=item B<-a>

Define all nodes to the DHCP server.  (Will only add nodes that can be reached, network-wise, by
this DHCP server.)  The dhcpd daemon does not have to be restarted after this.

=item I<noderange>

Add the specified nodes to the DHCP server configuration.

=item [B<-s> I<statements>]

For the input noderange, the argument will be interpreted like dhcpd.conf text.

=item B<-a -d>

Delete all nodes from the DHCP server configuration.

=item B<-d> I<noderange>

Delete all nodes in the noderange from the DHCP server configuration.

=item B<--hfi> I<noderange>

Add the specified nodes to the DHCP server configuration with HFI device type.

=item B<-h>

Display usage message.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

0 The command completed successfully.

1 An error has occurred.


=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

Add the network definitions to DHCP by updating the dhcpd.conf file:

 makedhcp -n

=item 2.

Define all nodes to the dhcp server:

 makedhcp -a

=item 3.

Will cause dhcp on the next request to set root-path appropriately for only node5.  Note some characters (e.g. ") must be doubly escaped (once for the shell, and once for the OMAPI layer).

 makedhcp node5 -s 'option root-path  \"172.16.0.1:/install/freebsd6.2/x86_64\";'
