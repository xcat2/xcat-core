B<copycds> - Copies Linux distributions and service levels from CDs/DVDs to install directory.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<copycds> [{B<-n|--name|--osver>}=I<distroname>] [{B<-a|--arch>}=I<architecture>] {I<iso>|I<device-path>} ...

B<copycds> [B<-h>|B<--help>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<copycds> command copies all contents of Distribution CDs/DVDs or Service Pack CDs/DVDs to the install directory as
designated in the B<site> table attribute: B<installdir>.  The B<copycds> command can copy from one or more ISO files,
or from the CD/DVD device path.  If xCAT doesn't recognize the signature of the CD/DVD (e.g. in the .discinfo
file), you must specify the -n and -a options.  This is sometimes the case for distros that have very
recently been released, and the xCAT code hasn't been updated for it yet.
