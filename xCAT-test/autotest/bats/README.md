# xCAT-test/autotest/bats

Shell-script unit tests live here and run with:

```bash
bats -r xCAT-test/autotest/bats
```

The GitHub Actions `xcat_test` workflow runs this command after the Perl `.t`
unit tests. Use BATS for shell behavior that can be exercised from the source
tree without an installed xCAT, a live management node, or real services.

Prefer sourcing an existing shell library or sourceable script and calling the
function under test. Keep reusable install-template helpers in
`xCAT-server/share/xcat/install/scripts/scriptlib`, and reusable postscript
helpers in `xCAT/postscripts/xcatlib.sh`. Use scratch directories and shadowed
commands so tests cannot write to the host.

Extraction helpers in `helpers/shell_source.bash` are only for legacy code that
cannot safely be sourced yet. Do not add Perl `.t` tests that grep shell source
when the behavior can be tested with BATS.
