# Native host tests

These tests use the source checkout with RPM tools, Linux namespaces or real
service binaries. They are separate from `unit/` and are not discovered by the
default pull-request unit run. Run them explicitly on a disposable Linux host.

Run the package and unprivileged namespace cases as an ordinary user:

```
prove xCAT-test/native/buildrpms_openeuler.t \
      xCAT-test/native/buildrpms_release_openeuler.t \
      xCAT-test/native/genesis_openeuler*.t \
      xCAT-test/native/openeuler_package_policy.t
```

Run the isolated system cases as root:

```
sudo prove xCAT-test/native/ip_forwarding.t \
      xCAT-test/native/openeuler_genimage_transactions.t \
      xCAT-test/native/openeuler_install_repositories.t \
      xCAT-test/native/openeuler_networking.t \
      xCAT-test/native/openeuler_xcatroot.t \
      xCAT-test/native/remoteshell_hostkeys_openeuler.t \
      xCAT-test/native/syslog_openeuler*.t
```

The PostgreSQL case starts a private server with only a Unix socket. Run it as
an ordinary user with `XCAT_TEST_PG_BINDIR` set to the directory containing
`initdb`, `pg_ctl`, `postgres`, `psql` and `createdb`:

```
XCAT_TEST_PG_BINDIR=/usr/bin prove xCAT-test/native/pgsqlsetup_native_schema.t
```

Check the TAP output for skipped prerequisites. A successful `prove` exit with
skipped cases does not qualify those cases.
