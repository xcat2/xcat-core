Appendix C: Migrating a Management Node to a Service Node
=========================================================

If you find you want to convert an existing Management Node to a Service
Node you need to work with the xCAT team. It is recommended for now, to
backup your database, setup your new Management Server, and restore your
database into it. Take the old Management Node and remove xCAT and all xCAT
directories, and your database. See ``Uninstalling_xCAT
<http://localhost/fake_todo>`_ and then follow the process for setting up a
SN as if it is a new node.
