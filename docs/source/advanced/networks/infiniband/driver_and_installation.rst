IB Driver Preparation and Installation
======================================

xCAT provides sample postscripts to help you install the Mellanox OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED) InfiniBand Driver. These scripts are located in ``opt/xcat/share/xcat/ib/scripts/Mellanox/``. You can use these scripts directly or change them to satisfy your own environment. **xCAT 2.11 drops support of mlnxofed_ib_install and recommends using version 2 of the script: mlnxofed_ib_install.v2**.
