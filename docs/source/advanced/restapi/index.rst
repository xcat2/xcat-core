Rest API
========

xCAT provides REST API (also called a web services API) that is currently implemented as a front end (translation layer) to xcatd. This provides programmatic access to xCAT from any language. This document describes how to set it up and use it.

**NOTE:** This doc is working with xCAT 2.8.4 and later.
