Pull Requests
=============

Creating Pull Requests
----------------------

Once your changes are ready to be submitted to the xcat team, the easiest way to generate a pull request is from the GitHub UI. 

#. Under your project, click on the "branches" link

#. Submit the pull request!


Reviewing Pull Requests as a Maintainer
---------------------------------------

When you are looking over a pull request, you can merge the changes into your own temporary branch to give the code or changes a try before merging into the parent project. 

#. From the merge request, click on the ``command line instructions`` link:
