GitHub
======

Developers are encouraged to fork the `xcat2 <https://github.com/xcat2>`_ repositories, make changes, and submit pull requests.  This mechanism allows for better collaboration and gives the community a chance to review and provide feedback before the code is pulled into the product. 

GitHub provides excellent documentation on `Collaborating <https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/>`_ and the following is only provided as a quick reference.
