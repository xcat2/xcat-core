Parallel Commands
=================

xCAT provides a set of commands that can run common remote commands (``ssh, scp, rsh, rcp, rsync, ping, cons``) in parallel on xCAT managed nodes.  The xCAT commands will format the output making the results easier to parse and help administrators manage large clusters.

The following commands are provided: 

    * ``pcons`` - runs a command on the noderange using the out-of-band console
    * ``pping`` - parallel ping
    * ``ppping`` - parallel ping between nodes in a cluster
    * ``prsync`` - parallel rsync
    * ``pscp`` - parallel remote copy ( supports scp and not hierarchy)
    * ``psh`` - parallel remote shell ( supports ssh and not hierarchy)
    * ``pasu`` - parallel ASU utility
    * ``xdcp`` - concurrently copies files to and from multiple nodes. ( scp/rcp and hierarchy)
    * ``xdsh`` - concurrently runs commands on multiple nodes. ( supports ssh/rsh and hierarchy)
    * ``xdshbak`` - formats the output of the xdsh command
    * ``xcoll`` - Formats command output of the psh, xdsh, rinv command


Examples for xdsh
-----------------

- To set up the SSH keys for root on node1, run as root: ::

    xdsh node1 -K

- To run the ps -ef command on node targets node1 and node2, enter: ::

    xdsh node1,node2 "ps -ef"

- To run the ps command on node targets node1 and run the remote command with the -v and -t flag, enter: ::

    xdsh node1,node2 -o"-v -t" ps =item *

- To execute the commands contained in myfile in the XCAT context on several node targets, with a fanout of 1, enter: ::

    xdsh node1,node2 -f 1 -e myfile

- To run the ps command on node1 and ignore all the dsh environment variable except the DSH_NODE_OPTS, enter: ::

    xdsh node1 -X `DSH_NODE_OPTS' ps

- To run on Linux, the xdsh command "dpkg | grep vim" on the node ubuntu diskless image, enter: ::

    xdsh -i /install/netboot/ubuntu14.04.2/ppc64el/compute/rootimg "dpkg -l|grep vim"

- To run xdsh with the non-root userid "user1" that has been setup as an xCAT userid and with sudo on node1 and node2 to run as root, do the following, see xCAT doc on Granting_Users_xCAT_privileges: ::

    xdsh node1,node2 --sudo -l user1 "cat /etc/passwd"

Examples for xdcp
-----------------

- To copy the /etc/hosts file from all nodes in the cluster to the /tmp/hosts.dir directory on the local host, enter: ::

    xdcp all -P /etc/hosts /tmp/hosts.dir

  A suffix specifying the name of the target is appended to each file name. The contents of the /tmp/hosts.dir directory are similar to: ::

   hosts._node1   hosts._node4   hosts._node7
   hosts._node2   hosts._node5   hosts._node8
   hosts._node3   hosts._node6

- To copy /localnode/smallfile and /tmp/bigfile to /tmp on node1 using rsync and input -t flag to rsync, enter: ::

    xdcp node1 -r /usr/bin/rsync -o "-t" /localnode/smallfile /tmp/bigfile /tmp

- To copy the /etc/hosts file from the local host to all the nodes in the cluster, enter: ::

    xdcp all /etc/hosts /etc/hosts

- To rsync the /etc/hosts file to your compute nodes:

  Create a rsync file /tmp/myrsync, with this line: ::

   /etc/hosts -> /etc/hosts

   or

   /etc/hosts -> /etc/ (last / is required)

  Run: ::

   xdcp compute -F /tmp/myrsync

- To rsync the /etc/file1 and file2 to your compute nodes and rename to filex and filey:

  Create a rsync file /tmp/myrsync, with these line: ::

   /etc/file1 -> /etc/filex

   /etc/file2 -> /etc/filey

  Run: ::

   xdcp compute -F /tmp/myrsync to update the Compute Nodes

- To rsync files in the Linux image at /install/netboot/ubuntu14.04.2/ppc64el/compute/rootimg on the MN:

  Create a rsync file /tmp/myrsync, with this line: ::

   /etc/hosts /etc/passwd -> /etc

  Run: ::

   xdcp -i /install/netboot/ubuntu14.04.2/ppc64el/compute/rootimg -F /tmp/myrsync
