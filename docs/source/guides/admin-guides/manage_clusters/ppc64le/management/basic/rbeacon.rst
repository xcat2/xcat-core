``rbeacon`` - Beacon Light
==========================

See :doc:`rbeacon manpage </guides/admin-guides/references/man1/rbeacon.1>` for more information.


Most enterprise level servers have LEDs on their front and/or rear panels, one of which is a beacon light.  If turned on, this light can assist the system administrator in locating one physical machine in the cluster.

Using xCAT, administrators can turn on and off the beacon light using: ``rbeacon <node> on|off``
