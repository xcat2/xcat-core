Virtual Machines
================


xCAT supports the following virtualization infrastructures:
 
**Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)**: 
  A full virtualization solution for Enterprise Linux distributions, known as the *de facto* open source virtualization mechanism and currently used by many software companies.

**IBM PowerKVM**: 
  A product that leverages the Power resilience and performance with the openness of KVM, which provides several advantages:

  *  Higher workload consolidation with processors overcommitment and memory sharing
  *  Dynamic addition and removal of virtual devices
  *  Microthreading scheduling granularity
  *  Integration with **IBM PowerVC** and **OpenStack**
  *  Simplified management using open source software
  *  Avoids vendor lock-in
  *  Uses POWER8 hardware features, such as SMT8 and microthreading

The xCAT based KVM solution offers users the ability to:

*  provision the hypervisor on bare metal nodes
*  provision virtual machines with the any OS supported in xCAT
*  migrate virtual machines to different hosts
*  install copy on write instances of virtual machines
*  clone virtual machines

This section introduces the steps of management node preparation, KVM hypervisor setup and virtual machine management, and presents some typical problems and solutions on xCAT kvm support.
