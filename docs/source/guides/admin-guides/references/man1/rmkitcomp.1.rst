EXAMPLES

1. To remove a kit component from osimage


.. code-block:: perl

  rmkitcomp -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64


Output is similar to:


.. code-block:: perl

  kitcomponents comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 were removed from osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute successfully


2. To remove a kit component even it is still used as a dependency of other kit component.


.. code-block:: perl

  rmkitcomp -f -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64


Output is similar to:


.. code-block:: perl

  kitcomponents comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 were removed from osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute successfully


3. To remove a kit component from osimage and also remove the kit component meta RPM and package RPM.  So in next genimage for statelss image and updatenode for stateful nodes, the kit component meta RPM and package RPM will be uninstalled.


.. code-block:: perl

  rmkitcomp -u -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64


Output is similar to:


.. code-block:: perl

  kitcomponents comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 were removed from osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute successfully
