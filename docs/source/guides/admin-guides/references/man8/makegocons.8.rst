\ **makegocons**\  - Register or unregister the node in the goconserver service


********
SYNOPSIS
********


\ **makegocons**\  [\ **-V|-**\ **-verbose**\ ] [\ **-d|-**\ **-delete**\ ] [\ *noderange*\ ]

\ **makeconservercf**\  [\ **-h|-**\ **-help|-v|-**\ **-version**\ ]


***********
DESCRIPTION
***********


The \ **makegocons**\  command will start the goconserver service if it is not started, then
send the REST request to create or delete the session resource in the goconserver service. The session
information including the session command or ssh connection parameters (for openbmc) is generated by xCAT
based on the records in the related tables (e.g. nodehm, ipmi, ppc, openbmc).

By default \ **makegocons**\  will register the session for all of the nodes in xCAT.

If a \ *noderange*\  is specified, only the session in the specified scope will be affected, goconserver
service will not be restarted and the other session will not be disconnected. This is the advantage
of goconserver over the conserver service with \ **makeconservercf**\ .

If \ **-d**\  is specified, \ **makegocons**\  will remove the session in the goconserver service.

In the case of a hierarchical cluster (i.e. one with service nodes) \ **makegocons**\  will determine
which nodes will have their consoles accessed from the management node and which from a service node
(based on the nodehm.conserver attribute).

For openbmc which uses ssh as the terminal session connection method, goconserver can help save the system
resources as goconserver could handle the ssh connection within goroutine which is more light-weighted than the command process.

\ **Note:**\  goconserver is an experimental feature, it will not be installed with xCAT and will only support the systemd based systems.
Download and setup the rpm or deb package manually. Release link:
