rmnodecfg
=========

::

    Usage: rmnodecfg [-h|--help] 

    Removes the configuration of a node so that the next time you reboot 
    it, it forces it to go through the discovery process.
    This does not remove it completely from xCAT.  You may want to do this
    command before running noderm to completely purge the system of the node
