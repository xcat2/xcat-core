DESCRIPTION
***********


Logical objects of this type are stored in the xCAT database in one or more tables.  Use the following commands
to manipulate the objects: \ **mkdef**\ , \ **chdef**\ , \ **lsdef**\ , and \ **rmdef**\ .  These commands will take care of
knowing which tables the object attributes should be stored in.  The attribute list below shows, in
parentheses, what tables each attribute is stored in.

\ **chain**\  (chain.chain)
 
 A comma-delimited chain of actions to be performed automatically when this node is discovered. ("Discovered" means a node booted, but xCAT and DHCP did not recognize the MAC of this node. In this situation, xCAT initiates the discovery process, the last step of which is to run the operations listed in this chain attribute, one by one.) Valid values:  boot, runcmd=<cmd>, runimage=<URL>, shell, standby. (Default - same as no chain - it will do only the discovery.).  Example, for BMC machines use: runcmd=bmcsetup,shell.

 The BladeCenter chassis the blade is in.
 


\ **cmdmapping**\  (nodehm.cmdmapping)

During node discovery, this attribute is initialized from the chain attribute and updated as the chain steps are executed.
 


\ **currstate**\  (chain.currstate)
 
 The current or next chain step to be executed on this node by xCAT-genesis.  Set by xCAT during node discovery or as a result of nodeset.
 


\ **dhcpinterfaces**\  (servicenode.dhcpinterfaces)
 
 The network interfaces DHCP server should listen on for the target node. This attribute can be used for management node and service nodes.  If defined, it will override the values defined in site.dhcpinterfaces. This is a comma separated list of device names. !remote! indicates a non-local network for relay DHCP.

\ **dockerflag**\  (vm.othersettings)
 
 This allows specifying a semicolon delimited list of key->value pairs to include in a vmx file of VMware or KVM. For partitioning on normal power machines, this option is used to specify the hugepage and/or bsr information, the value is like:'hugepage:1,bsr=2'. For KVM cpu pinning, this option is used to specify the physical cpu set on the host, the value is like:"vcpupin:'0-15,^8'",Its syntax is a comma separated list and a special markup using '-' and '^' (ex. '0-4', '0-3,^2') can also be allowed, the '-' denotes the range and the '^' denotes exclusive. For KVM memory binding, the value is like:'membind:0', restrict a guest to allocate memory from the specified set of NUMA nodes. For PCI passthrough, the value is like:'devpassthrough:pci_0001_01_00_0,pci_0000_03_00_0',the PCI devices are assigned to a virtual machine, and the virtual machine can use this I/O exclusively, the devices list are a list of PCI device names delimited with comma, the PCI device names can be obtained by running \ **virsh nodedev-list**\  on the host.

                 qcow2 is a sparse, copy-on-write capable format implemented at the virtualization layer rather than the filesystem level
             clonemethod=[qemu-img|reflink]
                 qemu-img allows use of qcow2 to generate virtualization layer copy-on-write
                 reflink uses a generic filesystem facility to clone the files on your behalf, but requires filesystem support such as btrfs
