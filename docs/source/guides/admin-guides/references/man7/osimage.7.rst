DESCRIPTION
***********


Logical objects of this type are stored in the xCAT database in one or more tables.  Use the following commands
to manipulate the objects: \ **mkdef**\ , \ **chdef**\ , \ **lsdef**\ , and \ **rmdef**\ .  These commands will take care of
knowing which tables the object attributes should be stored in.  The attribute list below shows, in
parentheses, what tables each attribute is stored in.


*******************
osimage Attributes:
*******************



\ **addkcmdline**\  (linuximage.addkcmdline)
 
 User specified arguments to be passed to the kernel.  The user arguments are appended to xCAT.s default kernel arguments. For the kernel options need to be persistent after installation, specify them with prefix "R::".  This attribute is ignored if linuximage.boottarget is set.
 


\ **boottarget**\  (linuximage.boottarget)
 
 The name of the boottarget definition.  When this attribute is set, xCAT will use the kernel, initrd and kernel params defined in the boottarget definition instead of the default.
 


\ **bosinst_data**\  (nimimage.bosinst_data)
 
 The name of a NIM bosinst_data resource.
 


\ **cfmdir**\  (osimage.cfmdir)
 
 CFM directory name for PCM. Set to /install/osimages/<osimage name>/cfmdir by PCM.
 


\ **configdump**\  (nimimage.configdump)
 
 Specifies the type of system dump to be collected. The values are selective, full, and none.  The default is selective.
 


\ **crashkernelsize**\  (linuximage.crashkernelsize)
 
 the size that assigned to the kdump kernel. If the kernel size is not set, 256M will be the default value.
 


\ **description**\  (osimage.description)
 
 OS Image Description
 


\ **driverupdatesrc**\  (linuximage.driverupdatesrc)
 
 The source of the drivers which need to be loaded during the boot. Two types of driver update source are supported: Driver update disk and Driver rpm package. The value for this attribute should be comma separated sources. Each source should be the format tab:full_path_of_srouce_file. The tab keyword can be: dud (for Driver update disk) and rpm (for driver rpm). If missing the tab, the rpm format is the default. e.g. dud:/install/dud/dd.img,rpm:/install/rpm/d.rpm
 


\ **dump**\  (linuximage.dump, nimimage.dump)
 
 The NFS directory to hold the Linux kernel dump file (vmcore) when the node with this image crashes, its format is "nfs://<nfs_server_ip>/<kdump_path>". If you want to use the node's "xcatmaster" (its SN or MN), <nfs_server_ip> can be left blank. For example, "nfs:///<kdump_path>" means the NFS directory to hold the kernel dump file is on the node's SN, or MN if there's no SN.
 
 or
 
 The name of the NIM dump resource.

\ **partitionfile**\  (linuximage.partitionfile, winimage.partitionfile)
 
 The path of the configuration file which will be used to partition the disk for the node. For stateful osimages,two types of files are supported: "<partition file absolute path>" which contains a partitioning definition that will be inserted directly into the generated autoinst configuration file and must be formatted for the corresponding OS installer (e.g. kickstart for RedHat, autoyast for SLES, pressed for Ubuntu).  "s:<partitioning script absolute path>" which specifies a shell script that will be run from the OS installer configuration file %pre section;  the script must write the correct partitioning definition into the file /tmp/partitionfile on the node which will be included into the configuration file during the install process. For statelite osimages, partitionfile should specify "<partition file absolute path>";  see the xCAT Statelite documentation for the xCAT defined format of this configuration file.For Ubuntu, besides  "<partition file absolute path>" or "s:<partitioning script absolute path>", the disk name(s) to partition must be specified in traditional, non-devfs format, delimited with space,  it can be specified in 2 forms: "d:<the absolute path of the disk name file>" which contains the disk name(s) to partition and "s:d:<the absolute path of the disk script>" which runs in pressed/early_command and writes the disk names into the "/tmp/xcat.install_disk" . To support other specific partition methods such as RAID or LVM in Ubuntu, some additional preseed values should be specified, these values can be specified with "c:<the absolute path of the additional pressed config file>" which contains the additional pressed entries in "d-i ..." form and "s:c:<the absolute path of the additional pressed config script>" which runs in pressed/early_command and set the preseed values with "debconf-set". The multiple values should be delimited with comma ","
 
 or
 
 The path of partition configuration file. Since the partition configuration for bios boot mode and uefi boot mode are different, this configuration file can include both configurations if you need to support both bios and uefi mode. Either way, you must specify the boot mode in the configuration. Example of partition configuration file: [BIOS]xxxxxxx[UEFI]yyyyyyy. To simplify the setting, you also can set installto in partitionfile with section like [INSTALLTO]0:1
 


\ **permission**\  (linuximage.permission)
 
 The mount permission of /.statelite directory is used, its default value is 755
 


\ **pkgdir**\  (linuximage.pkgdir)
 
 The name of the directory where the distro packages are stored. It could be set to multiple paths. The multiple paths must be separated by ",". The first path in the value of osimage.pkgdir must be the OS base pkg dir path, such as pkgdir=/install/rhels6.2/x86_64,/install/updates . In the os base pkg path, there are default repository data. And in the other pkg path(s), the users should make sure there are repository data. If not, use "createrepo" command to create them. For ubuntu, multiple mirrors can be specified in the pkgdir attribute, the mirrors must be prefixed by the protocol(http/ssh) and delimited with "," between each other.
 


\ **pkglist**\  (linuximage.pkglist)
 
 The fully qualified name of the file that stores the distro  packages list that will be included in the image. Make sure that if the pkgs in the pkglist have dependency pkgs, the dependency pkgs should be found in one of the pkgdir
 


\ **postbootscripts**\  (osimage.postbootscripts)
 
 Comma separated list of scripts that should be run on this after diskful installation or diskless boot. On AIX these scripts are run during the processing of /etc/inittab.  On Linux they are run at the init.d time. xCAT automatically adds the scripts in the xcatdefaults.postbootscripts attribute to run first in the list. See the site table runbootscripts attribute.
 


\ **postinstall**\  (linuximage.postinstall)
 
 The fully qualified name of the script file that will be run at the end of the genimage command. It could be set to multiple paths. The multiple paths must be separated by ",". It is used for diskless image only.
 


\ **postscripts**\  (osimage.postscripts)
 
 Comma separated list of scripts that should be run on this image after diskful installation or diskless boot. For installation of RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, the scripts will be run before the reboot. For installation of SLES, the scripts will be run after the reboot but before the init.d process. For diskless deployment, the scripts will be run at the init.d time, and xCAT will automatically add the list of scripts from the postbootscripts attribute to run after postscripts list. For installation of AIX, the scripts will run after the reboot and acts the same as the postbootscripts attribute.  For AIX, use the postbootscripts attribute. See the site table runbootscripts attribute.
 


\ **profile**\  (osimage.profile)
 
 The node usage category. For example compute, service.
 


\ **provmethod**\  (osimage.provmethod)
 
 The provisioning method for node deployment. The valid values are install, netboot,statelite,boottarget,dualboot,sysclone. If boottarget is set, you must set linuximage.boottarget to the name of the boottarget definition. It is not used by AIX.

\ **rootimgdir**\  (linuximage.rootimgdir)
 
 The directory name where the image is stored.  It is generally used for diskless image. it also can be used in sysclone environment to specify where the image captured from golden client is stored. in sysclone environment, rootimgdir is generally assigned to some default value by xcat, but you can specify your own store directory. just one thing need to be noticed, wherever you save the image, the name of last level directory must be the name of image. for example, if your image name is testimage and you want to save this image under home directoy, rootimgdir should be assigned to value /home/testimage/
