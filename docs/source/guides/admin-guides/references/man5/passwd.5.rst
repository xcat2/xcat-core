DESCRIPTION
***********


Contains default userids and passwords for xCAT to access cluster components.  In most cases, xCAT will also actually set the userid/password in the relevant component when it is being configured or installed.  Userids/passwords for specific cluster components can be overidden in other tables, e.g. mpa, ipmi, ppchcp, etc.
