nodelist Attributes:
********************



\ **node**\ 
 
 The hostname of a node in the cluster.
 


\ **groups**\ 
 
 A comma-delimited list of groups this node is a member of.  Group names are arbitrary, except all nodes should be part of the 'all' group. Internal group names are designated by using __<groupname>.  For example, __Unmanaged, could be the internal name for a group of nodes that is not managed by xCAT. Admins should avoid using the __ characters when defining their groups.
 


\ **status**\ 
 
 The current status of this node.  This attribute will be set by xCAT software.  Valid values: defined, booting, netbooting, booted, discovering, configuring, installing, alive, standingby, powering-off, unreachable. If blank, defined is assumed. The possible status change sequences are: For installation: defined->[discovering]->[configuring]->[standingby]->installing->booting->booted->[alive],  For diskless deployment: defined->[discovering]->[configuring]->[standingby]->netbooting->booted->[alive],  For booting: [alive/unreachable]->booting->[alive],  For powering off: [alive]->powering-off->[unreachable], For monitoring: alive->unreachable. Discovering and configuring are for x Series discovery process. Alive and unreachable are set only when there is a monitoring plug-in start monitor the node status for xCAT. Please note that the status values will not reflect the real node status if you change the state of the node from outside of xCAT (i.e. power off the node using HMC GUI).
