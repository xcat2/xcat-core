Advisory CVEs
-------------

* CVE-2015-0204 **RSA silently downgrades to EXPORT_RSA [Client]** (Severity: Low)

FREAK vulnerability CVE-2015-0204 is involved when 'RSA_EXPORT' ssl cipher suit is used in ssl server/client. 

Action
------

xCAT does not use RSA_EXPORT ciphers for ssl communication by default. However, xCAT does allow user to choose the ciphers from the site.xcatsslciphers attribute. 

Make sure you do not put RSA_EXPORT related ciphers in this attribute.

It is recommended that you upgrade openssl to 1.0.1L and upper version for the fix of this problem. Go to the os distribution to get the latest openssl package.
