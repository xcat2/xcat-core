Action
------

xCAT uses OpenSSL for client-server communication but **does not** ship it.  Regarding CVE-2016-0800, xCAT also does not use SSLv2 layer but uses the newer TLS transport layer security.  

It is recommended to keep your OpenSSL levels up-to-date with the indicated versions in the security bulletins to prevent any potential security threats.
