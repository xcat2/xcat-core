SW402273 - Unable to tell the firmware level that is actually running on the node via REST
==========================================================================================

* **Issue:** `SW402273 <https://w3.rchland.ibm.com/projects/bestquest/?defect=SW402273>`_
* **Reported:** 1738B (ibm-v1.99.10-0-r7)
* **Fixed:** 1740B (ibm-v1.99.10-0-r13)

**Issue:**

Until 1740B firmware (> ibm-v1.99.10-0-r13), there's no method provided by OpenBMC to indicate the active running firmware on the node.  Until the BMC is rebooted or the HOST is rebooted, the Active firmware may or may not really be running.

If you are running a version that prints the following message from ``rflash``:  ::

    cn01: WARNING, The current firmware is unable to detect running firmware version.

Please update the BMC to a version higher than ibm-v1.99.10-0-r13.
