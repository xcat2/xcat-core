SSH Access: Accessing the installer via "ssh"
---------------------------------------------

**This mode is only supported with debug level set to 2**

The ssh access to the installer is enabled, the admin can login into the installer through:

#. For RHEL, the installation won't halt, just login into the installer with ``ssh root@<node>``.

#. For SLES, the installation will halt after the ssh server is started, the console output looks like: ::

    ***  sshd has been started  ***


    ***  login using 'ssh -X root@<node>'  ***
    ***  run 'yast' to start the installation  ***

   Just as the message above suggests, the admin can open 2 sessions and run ``ssh -X root@<node>`` with the configured system password in the ``passwd`` table to login into the installer, then run ``yast`` to continue installation in one session and inspect the installation process in the installer in the other session. 

   After the installation is finished, the system requires a reboot. The installation will halt again before the system configuration, the console output looks like: ::

    *** Preparing SSH installation for reboot ***
    *** NOTE: after reboot, you have to reconnect and call yast.ssh ***

   Just as the message above suggests, the admin should run ``ssh -X root@<node>`` to access the installer and run ``yast.ssh`` to finish the installation.

   **Note**: For sles12, during the second stage of an SSH installation YaST freezes. It is blocked by the SuSEFirewall service because the ``SYSTEMCTL_OPTIONS`` environment variable is not set properly. Workaround: When logged in for the second time to start the second stage of the SSH installation, call **yast.ssh** with the ``--ignore-dependencies`` as follows: ::

    SYSTEMCTL_OPTIONS=--ignore-dependencies yast.ssh

#. For UBT, the installation will halt on the following similar message in the console: ::

   The admin can open 2 sessions and then select "Start installer" to continue installation in one session and select "Start shell" in the other session to inspect the installation process in the installer.
