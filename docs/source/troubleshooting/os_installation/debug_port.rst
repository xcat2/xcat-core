Enable Debug Port: Running commands in the installer from MN
------------------------------------------------------------

**This mode is only supported with debug level set to 1 or 2**

xCAT creates a server in the **installer** listening on port ``3001``. It executes commands sent to it from the xCAT MN and returns the response output.

The command ``runcmdinstaller`` can be used to send request to installer: ::

    Usage:

       runcmdinstaller <node> "<command>"

       make sure all the commands are quoted by ""

    Example:

       To list all the items under the /etc directory in the installer

       runcmdinstaller c910f03c01p03 "ls /etc"
