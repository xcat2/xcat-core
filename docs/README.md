# Welcome to the xCAT documentation

We are working on improving the documentation.  The latest docs are here: http://xcat-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

The documentation project is written in restructured text (.rst) using Sphinx. 
To build the docs locally: 

* Clone the project

* Using pip, install sphinx (See: http://pip.readthedocs.org/)
```
    pip install sphinx  
```

* Build the Docs
```
    cd xcat-core/docs
    make html
```

* View the docs by opening index.html from a web browser under xcat-core/docs/build/html/index.html
