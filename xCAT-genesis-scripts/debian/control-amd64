Description: xCAT genesis
 (Genesis Enhanced Netboot Environment for System Information and Servicing)
 is a small, embedded-like environment for xCAT's use in discovery and
 management actions when interaction with an OS is infeasible. This package
 reperesents the EPL content that is more tightly bound to specific xcat-core
 versions.
