=head1 NAME

An overview of the xCAT database.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The xCAT database contains user settings for the cluster and information gathered from the cluster.
It consists of a series of tables, which are described below.  To get more information about a
particular table, run man for that table name.  The tables can be manipulated directly using the
B<tabedit> or B<chtab> commands.  They can be viewed using B<nodels> or B<tabdump>.

Alternatively, the xCAT database can be viewed and edited as logical objects, instead of flat tables.
In this mode, xCAT takes care of which table each attribute should go in.  To treat the database
as logical object definitions, use the commands:  B<lsdef>, B<mkdef>, B<chdef>, B<rmdef>.  See Object Definitions
below.

xCAT allows the use of different database applications, depending on the needs of your cluster.
The default database is SQLite, which is a daemonless, zero-config database.  But you could instead
choose to use something like postgresql for greater scalability and remote access in the
hierarchical/service node case.  To use a different database or a different location, create
the file /etc/xcat/cfgloc.  See the appropriate xCAT docuementation for the format of the file for the database you choose. 
The following example /etc/xcat/cfgloc file is for PostgreSQL:

 Pg:dbname=xcat;host=<mgmtnode>|<pgadminuserid>|<pgadminpasswd>

where mgmtnode is the hostname of the management node adapter on the cluster side, and the pgadminuserid and pgadminpasswd are the database admin and password.

=head2 GROUPS AND REGULAR EXPRESSIONS IN TABLES

The xCAT database has a number of tables, some with rows that are keyed by node name
(such as noderes and nodehm) and others that are not keyed by node name (for example, the policy table).
The tables that are keyed by node name have some extra features that enable a more
template-based style to be used:

Any group name can be used in lieu of a node name in the node field, and that row will then
provide "default" attribute values for any node in that group.  A row with a specific node name
can then override one or more attribute values for that specific node.  For example, if the nodehm table contains:

 #node,power,mgt,cons,termserver,termport,conserver,serialport,serialspeed,serialflow,getmac,cmdmapping,comments,disable
 "mygroup",,"ipmi",,,,,,"19200",,,,,
 "node1",,,,,,,,"115200",,,,,

In the above example, the node group called mygroup sets mgt=ipmi and serialspeed=19200.  Any nodes that are in this group
will have those attribute values, unless overridden.  For example, if node2 is a member of mygroup, it will automatically
inherit these attribute values (even though it is not explicitly listed in this table).  In the case of node1 above, it
inherits mgt=ipmi, but overrides the serialspeed to be 115200, instead of 19200.  A useful, typical way to use this
capability is to create a node group for your nodes and for all the attribute values that are the same for every node,
set them at the group level.  Then you only have to set attributes for each node that vary from node to node.

xCAT extends the group capability so that it can also be used for attribute values that vary from node to node
in a very regular pattern.  For example, if in the ipmi table you want the bmc attribute to be set to whatever the nodename is with
"-bmc" appended to the end of it, then use this in the ipmi table:

 #node,bmc,bmcport,taggedvlan,bmcid,username,password,comments,disable
 "compute","/\z/-bmc/",,,,,,,

In this example, "compute" is a node group that contains all of the compute nodes.  The 2nd attribute (bmc) is a regular
expression that is similar to a substitution pattern.  The 1st part "\z" matches the end of the node name and substitutes "-bmc", effectively appending it to the node name.

Another example is if node1 is to have IP address 10.0.0.1, node2 is to have IP address 10.0.0.2, etc.,
then this could be represented in the hosts table with the single row:

 #node,ip,hostnames,otherinterfaces,comments,disable
 "compute","|node(\d+)|10.0.0.($1+0)|",,,,

In this example, the regular expression in the ip attribute uses "|" to separate the 1st and 2nd part.  This means that
xCAT will allow arithmetic operations in the 2nd part.  In the 1st part, "(\d+)", will match the number part of the node
name and put that in a variable called $1.  The 2nd part
is what value to give the ip attribute.  In this case it will set it to the string "10.0.0." and the number that is
in $1.  (Zero is added to $1 just to remove any leading zeroes.)

A more involved example is with the mp table.  If your blades have node names node01, node02, etc., and your chassis
node names are cmm01, cmm02, etc., then you might have an mp table like:

 #node,mpa,id,nodetype,comments,disable
 "blade","|\D+(\d+)|cmm(sprintf('%02d',($1-1)/14+1))|","|\D+(\d+)|(($1-1)%14+1)|",,

Before you panic, let me explain each column:

=over 4

=item B<blade>

This is a group name.  In this example, we are assuming that all of your blades belong to this
group.  Each time the xCAT software accesses the B<mp> table to get the management module and slot number
of a specific blade (e.g. B<node20>), this row will match (because B<node20> is in the B<blade> group).
Once this row is matched for B<node20>, then the processing described in the following items will take
place.

=item B<|\D+(\d+)|cmm(sprintf('%02d',($1-1)/14+1))|>

This is a perl substitution pattern that will produce the value for the second column of the table (the
management module hostname).  The text B<\D+(\d+)> between the 1st two vertical bars is
a regular expression that matches the node
name that was searched for in this table (in this example B<node20>).  The text that matches
within the 1st set of parentheses is set to $1.  (If there was a 2nd set of parentheses, it would
be set to $2, and so on.)  In our case, the \D+ matches the non-numeric part of the name
(B<node>) and the B<\d+> matches the numeric part (B<20>).  So $1 is set to B<20>.  The text B<cmm(sprintf('%02d',($1-1)/14+1))> between the
2nd and 3rd vertical bars produces the string that should be used as the value for the mpa attribute for node20.
Since $1 is set to 20, the expression B<($1-1)/14+1> equals
19/14 + 1, which equals 2.  (The division is integer division,
so 19/14 equals 1.  Fourteen is used as the divisor, because there are 14 blades in each chassis.)  The value of 2 is then passed into sprintf() with a format string to add a leading
zero, if necessary, to always make the number two digits.  Lastly the string B<cmm> is added to the beginning,
making the resulting string B<cmm02>, which will be used as the hostname
of the management module.

=item B<|\D+(\d+)|(($1-1)%14+1)|>

This item is similar to the one above.  This substituion pattern will produce the value for
the 3rd column (the chassis slot number for this blade).  Because this row was
the match for B<node20>, the parentheses
within the 1st set of vertical bars will set $1 to 20.  Since % means modulo division, the
expression B<($1-1)%14+1> will evaluate to B<6>.

=head2 Easy Regular Expressions 

As of xCAT 2.8.1, you can use a modified version of the regular expression support described in the previous section. You do not need to enter the node information (1st part of the expression), it will be derived from the input nodename. You only need to supply the 2nd part of the expression to determine the value to give the attribute. For examples, see 

http://xcat-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guides/admin-guides/basic_concepts/xcat_db/regexp_db.html#easy-regular-expressions

=head1 OBJECT DEFINITIONS

Because it can get confusing what attributes need to go in what tables, the xCAT database can also
be viewed and edited as logical objects, instead of flat tables.  Use B<mkdef>, B<chdef>, B<lsdef>,
and B<rmdef> to create, change, list, and delete objects.
When using these commands, the object attributes will be stored in the same tables, as if you edited
the tables by hand.  The only difference is that the object commands take care of knowing which tables
all of the information should go in.

=head2 B<xCAT Object Name Format>:


B<xCAT Object Name Format> is defined by the following regex:

 ^([A-Za-z-]+)([0-9]+)(([A-Za-z-]+[A-Za-z0-9-]*)*)

In plain English, an object name is in B<xCAT Object Name Format> if starting from the begining there are:

=over 2

=item *

one or more alpha characters of any case and any number of "-" in any combination

=item *

followed by one or more numbers

=item *

then optionally followed by one alpha character of any case  or "-"

=item *

followed by any combination of case mixed alphanumerics and "-"

=head2 B<Object Types>

To run man for any of the object definitions below, use section 7.  For example:  B<man 7 node>

The object types are:

=over 2
EOS1

foreach my $def (sort keys %$defdescriptions) {
	print FILE "\n=item L<$def(7)|$def.7>\n";
}

	print FILE <<"EOS2";

=back

=head1 TABLES

To manipulate the tables directly, use B<nodels(1)>, B<chtab(8)>, B<tabdump(8)>, B<tabedit(8)>,
B<nodeadd(8)>, B<nodech(1)>.

To run man for any of the table descriptions below, use section 5.  For example:  B<man 5 nodehm>

The tables are:

=over 2
EOS2

foreach my $table (sort keys %$descriptions) {
	print FILE "\n=item L<$table(5)|$table.5>\n\n".$descriptions->{$table}."\n";
}

	print FILE <<"EOS3";
