# Hash of message ids.  Message ids should be in uppercase.  'ALL' should not
# be used as a message id as this indicates that all messages are wanted.
# For each message id there is another hash with additional info:
#   severity - Severity of message and indicate whether it gets a header to the
#              message text (e.g. "Error (IVP:MAINT01) " )
#                  0 - no message header, unrated output
#                  1 - bypass message used by automated tests
#                  2 - information message with "Info" header
#                  3 - unknown message severity
#                  4 - warning message with "Warning" header
#                  5 - error message with "Error" header
#   recAction - Recommended action:
#                   0 - non-fatal message, continue processing
#                   1 - fatal message, end further processing
#   explain  - Further explanation of the message.
#   subTab   - (optional) Indicates the tabbing characters to use.  This is
#              used to control whether subsequent lines of a message are
#              indented.  The default is '\t', to indent the lines.
#   sysAct   - System action to be performed.  Normally, this is not specified
#              because the severity generates a default system action.
#   userResp - Suggested user response.
